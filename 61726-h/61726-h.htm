  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“The problem of the twentieth century,” says
Mr. W. B. Du Bois, “is the problem of the colour
line.” That, no doubt, is the view of a man born
“within the veil”; but, whatever our point of
view, we cannot but admit that racial adjustment
is one of the two or three most urgent problems
of the near future.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ought the colour-lines drawn by Nature to be
enforced by human ordinance, and even by geographical
segregation? Or ought they to be
gradually obliterated by free intermingling and
intermarriage? Or, while intermarriage is forbidden
(whether by law or public sentiment), is it
possible for people of different colours to dwell
together in approximately equal numbers and on
terms of democratic equality? Or is it for the
benefit of both races that one race should always
maintain, by social and political discriminations,
its superiority over the other? Or is this opinion
a mere hypocritical disguise of the instinct which
begot, and maintained throughout the ages, the
“institution” of slavery?</p>

<p class='c001'>These are questions which the coming century
will have to answer, not only in America, but in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>Africa. It is in the Southern United States, however,
that the problem presents itself in its acutest
and most fully developed form. In South Africa
it is looming ahead, in America it is present and
hourly insistent. Though the conditions in the
two countries can never be precisely similar, yet
the experience of the one ought certainly to be of
the utmost value in shaping the counsels of the
other. My interest, then, in the colour-question
in the South was not a mere abstract interest in
an alien problem; nor was it due solely to the
special sympathy for America and all things
American which (I am happy to say) has been
strong in me from my youth upward. It was a
personal interest which ought, I think, to be
shared by every Englishman who is so far an
Imperialist as to feel that he cannot simply wash
his hands of the problems of Empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was heightened, moreover, by the feeling
that a great deal of what passes in England as
advanced thought on the subject of race-relations
is very superficial and remote from the realities of
the case. This suspicion had for some time beset
me, and was perhaps the main factor in inducing
me to utilize a rare interval of leisure in getting
into touch with the facts of the problem as it
presents itself in Afro-America.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some thinkers display an almost furious antipathy
to the very idea of race. They hold it a
mere superstition or illusion, and look forward, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>only with equanimity, but with eagerness, to an
obliteration of all race-boundaries in a universal
“pan-mixture.” I cannot believe that this is a
true ideal of progress; nor does it seem to me
that the world at large is verging in that direction.
No considerable fusion is taking place between
the European and the Asiatic races. No one
dreams of seeking on that line the solution of our
difficulties in India. No practical politician
dreams of encouraging yellow immigration into
America or Australia on the same terms of permanent
citizenship and free intermixture that
obtain in the case of white settlers. If the
myriads of China and Japan are to “expand” in
the same sense in which the European races have
expanded, it must be by conquest and something
like extermination. That is, in fact, the “yellow
peril” which haunts so many dreams.</p>

<p class='c001'>The truth is, it seems to me, that no race
problem, properly so called, arises until two races
are found occupying the same territory in such
an approach to equal numbers as to make it a
serious question which colour shall ultimately
predominate. A handful of white administrators,
as in India, or of white traders, as in China and
Japan, may give rise, no doubt, to important and
difficult questions, but they are not specifically
questions of race. No one doubts that India
belongs to the Indians; that is the theory of the
British “raj” no less than of the most fervid
Nationalist; the dispute is as to whether the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>Indian people do or do not benefit by the British
administration. So, too, in China and Japan:
it may be doubtful whether the privileges accorded
to foreigners are judicious, but neither the racial
integrity nor the political autonomy of the yellow
races is for a moment in question. The race
problem means (in its only convenient definition)
the problem of adjustment between two very
dissimilar populations, locally intermingled in
such proportions that the one feels its racial
identity potentially threatened, while the other
knows itself in constant danger of economic
exploitation. Now these conditions, as a matter
of experience, arise only where a race of very
high development is brought into contact with a
race of very low development, and only where the
race of low development is at the same time
tenacious of life and capable of resisting the
poisons of civilization. In other words, the race
problem, as here defined, is a purely Afro-European
or Afro-American problem.</p>

<p class='c001'>Where civilization has met civilization, as in
India, China, Japan, there has never been any
question of local intermixture in such proportions
as to give rise to the conditions indicated. Where
civilization has met savagery, elsewhere than in
Africa, the savage race has generally dwindled to
a degraded and negligible remnant. The African
races alone have shown considerable tenacity of
life and considerable power of putting on at any
rate a veneer of civilization. This is as much as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>to say that only between Europeans and Africans
has the active competition arisen which is the
essence of the race problem. In some parts of
Spanish America it has resulted in the practical
fusion of the races; a solution which, as above
noted, commends itself to some thinkers. But
where fusion is resisted, the problem must one
day become acute; and that day has arrived in
the Southern States. There the two races are
more nearly than anywhere else on a footing of
numerical equality; there, more than anywhere
else, is the ambition of the African race stimulated
by political theory and seconded by education,
organization, and considerable material resources.
The Southern States, then, are, so to speak, the
great crucible in which this experiment in inter-racial
chemistry is working itself out. There you
can watch the elements simmering. To some
hopeful eyes they may even seem to be clarifying
and settling down. The following pages will show
that I, personally, am not confident of any
desirable solution, unless a new element of
far-sighted statesmanship can be thrown into the
brew.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Ray Stannard Baker, author of that
admirable series of studies, “Following the Colour-Line,”
was good enough to map out for me a zig-zag
tour through the States east of the Mississippi,
which enabled me to employ my time to the best
advantage. I was also much indebted to Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>Baker, as well as to Mr. Walter H. Page and
Dr. Booker Washington, for many valuable introductions.
Wherever I went, my first preoccupation
was with the colour question; but I also
welcomed the opportunity to see something of
the great agricultural, industrial, and educational
revival which is rapidly transmuting the South
from a ghost-haunted region of depression and
impoverishment into one of the most eagerly
progressive, and probably one of the wealthiest,
of modern communities. This book, then, is
mainly to be regarded as a series of rapid
impressions of travel, intermingled with conversations,
in which I try to present the colour-problem
from various points of view, and to
suggest the temper in which it is approached by
men of both races. In the middle of my travel-sketches,
however, at the point where I leave the
American Continent, I have inserted an essay of
some length which embodies my reflections on the
preceding <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“choses vues”</span> with such tentative conclusions
as I felt justified in drawing. This essay,
which appeared in <cite>McClure’s Magazine</cite> for July, 1909,
has elicited a good deal of criticism in the South,
which has led me to modify one or two passages. I
am happy to say, however, that none of the criticism
which has reached me, either privately or through
the Press, has been in any sense hostile. Many
critics have declared impossible the only solution
of the problem which at all commends itself to
me; but only one out of a hundred or thereabouts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>has accused me of seriously misrepresenting the
conditions.</p>

<p class='c001'>From Florida, I proceeded by way of Cuba and
Jamaica to a detached but very important section
of the United States, the Canal Zone at Panama.
I make no apology for including in this book
a few notes of that journey. For one thing, I
was still in Afro-America, still studying certain
aspects of the colour-problem. But another
motive prompts the inclusion of these sketches—the
hope that some readers may be moved to
follow in my footsteps, and enjoy a very delightful
and interesting tour. Anything is worth doing,
in my judgment, that tends to encourage Englishmen
to cross the Atlantic. If any considerable
proportion of the English travelling public could
be induced to set their faces westward, we should
soon get rid of many of the little prejudices
and ignorances which still interpose themselves
between the two branches of the Anglo-Saxon
stem. The route which I followed—roughly,
New York, Washington, Memphis, New Orleans,
Charleston, Florida, Cuba, Jamaica, Panama,
Cartagena, Trinidad, Southampton—is as easy
and comfortable as it is interesting and instructive.
No doubt the completion of the
Canal will carry a rush of travel in this
direction. But even before the gates of the
Pacific are opened, I see no reason why the
fascinating ferment of the Southern States,
in conjunction with the glorious beauty of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>West Indies, should not attract the travelling
Briton.</p>

<p class='c001'>The chapters in the First Part of this book
appeared, with two exceptions, in the <cite>Westminster
Gazette</cite>; those in the Third Part, with one
exception, appeared either in the <cite>Morning Leader</cite>
or the <cite>Pall Mall Magazine</cite>. The chapters on
Hampton and on Jamaica are here printed for the
first time.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>I <br /> ON THE THRESHOLD</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The scene is Chicago; the occasion, a luncheon-party
at the Cliff-Dwellers’ Club. All the intellect
and talent of the Middle West (I am credibly
assured) are gathered round one long table. I
mention to an eminent man of letters that I am
going into the South.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well,” he says, “you are going into a
country that is more foreign to me than most
parts of Europe. I do not understand the
Southern people, or their way of looking at things.
I never feel at home among them. The one
thing I have in common with them is a strong
antipathy to the black man.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This, of course, is only an individual point of
view; but many other men are listening, and,
while some nod assent, no one protests.</p>

<p class='c001'>But here is another point of view. A few days
later I met an old friend, a Philadelphian, who
said, “I like the South and the Southerners.
They are men of our own stock and our own
tongue—even the ‘poor whites’ whom slavery and
the hookworm have driven to the wall. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>North we are being jostled and elbowed aside by
the foreigner, who murders our speech, and
knows nothing and cares nothing about our
history or traditions. Yes; give me the South.
It is true that, intellectually, it scarcely exists.
The Southerner may be living in the twentieth
century, but he has skipped the nineteenth. His
knowledge of literature, for instance, if he have
any at all, stops at the Waverley Novels and
‘The Corsair.’ But I’m not sure that that isn’t
part of the charm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus early did I learn that no two men can
talk to you about the South without flatly contradicting
each other.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was evident that my plan must be simply to
gather views and impressions as I went along,
and trust to sifting and co-ordinating them
later.</p>

<p class='c001'>An invitation, equivalent to a command, called
me to Washington. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Nearing the Colour-line.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> For a whole day my slow train
dragged wearily through Northern
Ohio; and in the course of that
day two young couples in succession
got into my car, who interested me not a little.
In each case it seemed to me that the girl had a
streak of black blood in her, while the young man
was in each case unimpeachably white. As to one
of the girls, I was practically certain; as to the
other I may have been mistaken. Her features
were aquiline and she was uncommonly handsome;
but the tint of her skin, and more especially of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>her eyeballs, strongly suggested an African strain.
Both girls were lively, intelligent, well-spoken,
well-dressed, well-mannered—distinctly superior,
one would have said, to the commonplace youths
by whom they were accompanied. Yet I felt
pretty certain that a few hours’ travel would have
taken them into regions where they would be
forbidden by law to sit in the same railroad-car,
and where marriage between them would be
illegal.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At any rate, even supposing that in these
particular cases my conjecture was mistaken, it
was not on the face of it improbable. On the
other side of the Ohio River, these girls would
have had, so to speak, to clear themselves of the
suspicion of African blood, else any association
on equal terms between them and their male
companions would have been regarded as an
outrage. This seemed a senseless and barbarous
state of affairs. But I was there to observe, not
(as yet) to form conclusions; and I kept my mind
open, wondering whether, in the coming weeks,
I should discover any reason or excuse for the
apparent barbarism.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Indiana, rain; in Ohio, torrents; at Pittsburg,
a deluge. But when I awaken next morning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>just on Mason and Dixon’s line, the sun is
shining on the woods of Maryland, and I feel at
once that the South and the spring
are here. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“Summer is i-cumen in.”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> These spring coppices are
far richer in colour than any of our
English woods. They run the whole gamut of
green, from the blue-green of the pine to the silver-green
of the poplar and the gold-green of the
birch; and the greens are freely interspersed with
red and yellow foliage, and with white and pink
blossoms. The red is that of the maple, whose
blush at birth is almost as vivid as its flush in
death.</p>

<p class='c001'>The new Union Station at Washington is a
vast and grandiose palace of shining white. Its
“concourse” (a new American word for the
central hall of a station) seems a really impressive
piece of architecture. But it is a Sabbath Day’s
journey from the platforms to the cabs; and the
porters seem to be making a Sabbath Day of it,
for I cannot find a single one. Let me not
embark, however, on the endless story of a
traveller’s tribulations. Every country has its own
inconveniences, and recriminations are not only
idle but mischievous.</p>

<p class='c001'>The city of Washington is one great sea of
exquisite green, out of which the buildings rise
like marble rocks and islands. Yes, I am in the
South; the leafless elms of New England and
the shrewd, bracing blasts of New York are left
behind.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>And this day of sunshine was the first of many
days. Save for a few thunder-showers, the South
was to be all sunshine for me.</p>

<p class='c001'>And with the sunshine—the Negro. Here he
is in his thousands, and in his deepest dye.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Question of Elbow-room.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In the
North one sees him now and then,
but he is swamped and submerged
in the crowds of the great cities.
To be very clearly conscious of his presence you
must go to special quarters of New York or Chicago.
“Coloured persons” (seldom pure blacks) are
waiters at hotels and clubs, but no longer at the
best hotels and clubs. The Pullman porter is always
coloured; so are most, if not all, of the ordinary
railway porters—when there are any. But “at
the North” (as they say here) you have to go out
of your way to find any problem in the negro.
The black strand in the web of life is not yet particularly
prominent—whatever it may be destined
to become.</p>

<p class='c001'>But here in Washington the web of life is a
chequer of black-and-white—a shepherd’s tartan,
I think they call it. In 1900 there were over
85,000 negroes in the city—now there must be at
least 100,000, in a total population of considerably
under a quarter of a million, or something like the
population of Nottingham.</p>

<p class='c001'>Imagine nearly half the population of Nottingham
suddenly converted into black and brown
people—people different not only in colour but in
many other physical characteristics from you and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>me. Imagine that all the most striking of these
differences are in the direction of what our deepest
instincts, inherited through a thousand generations,
compel us to regard as ugliness—an ugliness often
grotesque and simian.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Imagine that this horrible
metamorphosis--or, if you shy at the word
“horrible,” let us say fantastic—imagine this
fantastic metamorphosis to have taken place as
a punishment for certain ancestral crimes and
stupidities, of which the living men and women
of to-day are personally innocent. Can you
conceive that, after the first shock of surprise
was over, Nottingham would take up life again
as a mere matter of course, feeling that there
was no misfortune in this mingling of incongruities,
no problem in the adjustment of their
relations?</p>

<p class='c001'>Do not object that in Washington there has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>been no sudden metamorphosis, but that the
condition of things has gradually come to pass
through the slow operation of historic forces.
That makes no real difference, save that the
Washingtonian has no “first shock of surprise”
to get over. The essence of the matter is that
half of the elbow-room of life is taken up by an alien
race. Even disregarding, as (perhaps) temporary
and corrigible, the condition of hostility between
the races, we cannot but see in the bare fact of
their juxtaposition in almost equal numbers, and,
theoretically, on a standing of equal citizenship,
an anomalous condition of affairs, as to the
probable outcome of which history affords us no
guidance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Walk the streets of Washington for a single
day, and you will realize that the colour-problem
is not, as some English and Northern American
writers assume, a chimera sprung from nothing
but the inhuman prejudice of the Southern white.
It is not a simple matter which a little patience
and good-temper will presently arrange. It is a
real, a terrible difficulty, not to be overcome by
happy-go-lucky humanitarianism.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be a great pity that Nature implanted
race-instincts deep in our breasts—Nature has
done so many thoughtless things in her day.
But there they are, not to be ignored or sentimentalized
away. They are part of the stuff of
human character, out of which the future must
be shaped. The wise statesman will no more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>disregard them than the wise carpenter will
disregard the grain of a piece of timber—or the
knots in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>One principle I arrived at very early in this
investigation—namely, that black is not always
white, nor white invariably black.</p>

<hr class='c014' />
<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. “Intermarriage between the races is forbidden by law in all the
Southern States, and also in the following Northern and Western
States: Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana,
Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Utah. In all other
Northern and Western States marriage between the races is lawful.”—Ray
Stannard Baker: “Following the Colour-Line.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. There is no doubt, I think, that the white man—and here I mean
not the Southerner, nor the American, but the white man as such—resents
in extremes of the negro type just that air of caricaturing humanity
which renders the monkey tribe so painful and humiliating to contemplate.
This seems an inhuman saying, but instinctive emotions are
fundamental facts which it is useless to blink. And the suggestion of
caricature is the stronger, the more closely the negro mimics the white
man in dress and bearing. In Washington, on a Sunday, one meets
scores of fat, middle-aged negro women, decked out in an exaggerated
extreme of European fashion, from whom one can only look away as
from something grotesque and degrading—a page of Swift at his
bitterest. Yet the same women in cotton gowns and bandana headgear
might look far from unpleasing. No doubt the like uneasy sense of
humiliation besets one on seeing white women decked in finery unsuited
to their age or their contours. But that does not alter the fact that
the urban negro of either sex, when he or she indulges in extremes of
European adornment, is a spectacle highly disturbing to Caucasian
self-complacency. Caricature is none the more agreeable for being, in
a certain sense, just.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>II <br /> THE BLACK MAN’S PARADISE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It was my good fortune to have for my hosts in
Washington two active sympathizers with the
negro. The husband hails from a North-Western
State; the wife is a New Englander. They knew
personally some of the Abolitionist leaders, and
are still full of their spirit.</p>

<p class='c001'>They related to me cruel and deplorable
incidents in the everyday life of the streets.</p>

<p class='c001'>“One afternoon,” said my host, “I was sitting
peaceably in a street-car, when I was suddenly
conscious of an altercation between the conductor
and a coloured man. The absolute rights of the
matter I don’t know, but it had somehow arisen
out of a recent modification of the ‘transfer’
system, which the coloured man probably did
not understand. I had scarcely realized what
was happening, before men were standing on
the seats of the car, shouting, ‘Kill the d——d
nigger! We’ll all stand by you! All Virginia is
behind you!’ The motor-man detached the
heavy brass handle by which he works the car,
ran up to the negro, and had actually raised it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>to strike. I interposed, and told the man that,
if anything happened, he would get into trouble
for leaving his post. He replied: ‘The nigger’s
abusive,’ but sullenly went back to his platform.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“<em>Was</em> the nigger abusive?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know. I didn’t hear him say anything;
but it is quite possible that he had been
‘sassy.’ All I know is that he stood his ground
like a man, with that yelling crowd around him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what happened?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, the thing blew over. The negro walked
away, and the crowd dispersed. As I took my
seat again in the car, the man next me said,
‘If that had happened in South Carolina, he
would have been a dead nigger.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not long ago,” my hostess said, “I was in a
crowded street-car. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Street-Car Episodes.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A black woman with a baby
got in, and had to stand. You
know how our Washington cars are
constantly rounding corners; and at
every curve the woman was nearly thrown from
her feet. Presently one of two white shop-girls
who were sitting near her rose and gave the mother
her place. The two girls soon after got out; and
as they passed me, the one who had kept her seat
said to the other, ‘I wonder you would do such
a thing!’ ‘Didn’t you see she had a baby?’
the other replied; so, after all, we are not quite
without humanity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But tell about the two boys,” my host
put in.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Oh, that was two or three years ago. I
noticed in a street-car a very distinguished-looking
old man with two boys of about fourteen and
twelve, evidently his grandsons. I thought what
very nicely-mannered boys they were. A white
woman got in, and, the car being full, the elder
boy rose and gave her his seat. Immediately
after, a mulatto woman got in, very well and
quietly dressed—entirely a lady in manner and
appearance. The younger boy was rising to give
her his seat, when the elder pushed him down
angrily, saying quite aloud, ‘I thought you knew
better than to get up for a nigger.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Did the lady hear?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, perfectly. It was most painful.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what said the distinguished grandfather?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He smiled, and nodded to the elder boy.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mr. Roosevelt and the Washerwoman.</div>

<p class='c001'>I took out my pocket-book and handed my
hostess a cutting I had made a few
days before. It was a letter signed
“Edgar S. Walz,” and ran thus:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“To the Editor of the <cite>New York Times</cite>.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I read in your Sunday’s issue an item headed
‘Subway Manners: Boys keep their Seats rather
than Give to a Sick Old Woman,’ which reminds me
of the first time I saw Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, about
eight or nine years ago. He was sitting next to me in
a Broadway car, and somewhere along about Thirtieth-street
the car stopped to let some people on. All secured
seats except a coloured woman with a large bundle of
clothes. As soon as Mr. Roosevelt saw that she had to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>stand, he jumped up, took off his hat, and bowed as
graciously as though she were the first woman in the
land.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” said my hostess, as she handed back
the cutting; “you will find these differences.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of course,” I said, “Mr. Roosevelt is a
Northerner.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’m afraid that doesn’t always mean liberality
of feeling nowadays,” was the reply. “I should
rather say Mr. Roosevelt is Mr. Roosevelt.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My host is a chief of department in a large
Government office.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sent to Coventry.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Have you any coloured people
working under you?” I asked him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not long ago,” he replied, “a
coloured girl was sent to me—I think because
they knew that I would ‘kick’ less than any
other chief of department. It was suggested to
me that I should assign her some special work by
herself. I refused. ‘No,’ I said, ‘if she comes
to me at all, she follows the regular routine.’
I made a point of speaking to the three most
responsible young women among my clerks—all
girls of good family and standing—and telling
them they must behave well to her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how did they behave?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, well enough, on the surface; there was
no trouble; but she was quietly sent to Coventry.
Soon afterwards a Russian girl entered the department,
who knew nothing and cared nothing about
our prejudices. She made friends with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>coloured girl; but when she sat at the same
table with her in the lunch-room, the quadroon
herself said to her, ‘You mustn’t do this; you’ll
get into trouble with the others. They don’t
behave badly to me; but when I seat myself even
at the other end of a long table they make an
excuse to move away.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How are negroes placed in these positions?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, through various political ‘pulls.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you think it a wise policy to try to break
down the colour-line here and there—at this point
and that—by the nomination of negroes to Government
appointments?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, that is just the question.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Meantime,” I asked, “are matters getting
better or worse?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, worse—decidedly worse,” said my hostess.
“They are coming to something like open war.
For instance, I constantly see stone-fights between
white boys and black boys in the open space
outside our house. That doesn’t mean much,
perhaps; for boys will be boys everywhere. But
sometimes lately the white boys have seemed to
go frantic, and have begun stoning black men and
women who were going peaceably about their
business. Once I had to telephone to the police
to interfere, or I believe there would have been
a riot.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am told that in New York the white and
black street-boys play amicably together.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“Yes,” said my host, “that is because the
blacks are comparatively few. The tension increases
in the direct ratio of the number of
negroes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This I find to be essentially, if not quite
universally, true. What is the inference? Is it
not at bottom an instinct of self-preservation that
spurs the South to inhumanity—an unreasoning,
or half-reasoned, panic fear of racial submergence?
There are many other factors in the situation;
but I think, beyond all doubt, this is one.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You can see any day on the street-cars,” said
my host, “the embitterment of feeling. Formerly
a black man would always rise and give his seat
to a white woman; now he aggressively refrains
from doing so.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I repeated this to a friend in Baltimore, a
gentleman of an old Southern family, who had
fought for the Confederacy, even
while he realized that the institution
of slavery was doomed. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Pessimistic View.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “You must
remember,” he said, “that the problem is acute
in Washington. The Washington negro is particularly
bumptious and intolerable. Immediately
after the war, Washington was the black
man’s paradise. They flocked there in their
thousands, thinking that the Government was
going to do everything for them, and that there
was nothing they had not a right to expect.
That spirit still survives and makes trouble.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how do you feel as to the way things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>are shaping? Do you see any actual or probable
improvement in the relations of the races?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What shall I say?” he replied. “I do all I
can to put the matter out of my thoughts. I do
not personally feel the pinch of the problem. My
children are in the North, and my life here pursues
an even routine. I have old coloured
servants, with whom I get on very well. But
I am constitutionally a pessimist, and I confess
I do not see how the thing is going to work out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Education?” I suggested.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Education is all very well; but if it removes
some difficulties it raises others. It tends to
make the negro unwilling to work where he is
wanted, and desirous of working where he is not
wanted—at any rate by the white artisan who is
in the field before him. The industrial education
of the black race, which is in some quarters
regarded as a panacea, will no doubt do a great
deal of good; but we cannot close our eyes to
the fact that it will intensify race-friction in the
labour market.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Still, you are not one of the Southerners
who want to keep the black ignorant—who think
that education, as a whole, merely teaches him
‘not to know his place’?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is an outworn and impossible point of
view. But you can understand that even the
reasonable Southerner feels a certain bitterness on
the subject of education when he sees the black
child marching off to a school provided by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Northern philanthropy, while the child of the ‘poor
white’ goes into the cotton-factory.”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“You say you have black servants?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh yes, I have; and many people still have.
But you know the race as a whole is turning
against domestic service. I have friends in
Mobile, Alabama, who tell me that their servants
make the most fantastic conditions. For instance,
they won’t do a stroke of work after three o’clock.
If you want a meal after that hour, you must prepare
and serve it yourself. As for the abstraction
of household stuff from the kitchen, it is carried
on openly and systematically—they call it ‘Cook’s
excursion.’ In the case of domestic service, in
fact, the difficult conditions which are being felt
all over the world are intensified by—what shall
I call it?—the race pride, or the race resentment,
of the black. Domestic service was one of the
badges of slavery; and now, if he or she will
undertake it at all, it must be on such terms as
shall remove from it all taint of servility.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A very natural feeling,” I remarked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No doubt; but not calculated to relieve the
friction between the races.”</p>

<hr class='c014' />
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. It is not only the child of the “poor white,” in the special
Southern sense of the term, that goes to the factory. Mr. Stannard
Baker, in “Following the Colour-Line,” says: “One day I visited the
mill neighbourhood of Atlanta to see how the poorer classes of white
people lived. I found one very comfortable home occupied by a family
of mill employees. They hired a negro woman to cook for them, and
while they sent their children to the mill to work, the cook sent her
children to school!”</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>III <br /> THE NIGHTMARE OF THE SOUTH</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>My original plan had been to go from Washington
to Hampton, Virginia, and see the great industrial
school for negroes and Indians established
by General Samuel Armstrong, the <em>alma mater</em> of
Mr. Booker Washington, and consequently of
Tuskegee. But I found that both the President
of Hampton and the President of the University
of Virginia at Charlottesville were to be at a
Southern Education Conference at Memphis; so,
instead of going due south into Virginia, I turned
my face south-westward towards Kentucky and
Tennessee. But I determined to “stop off” for
a day at Virginia Hot Springs, where some friends
had invited me to visit them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Virginia Hot Springs is nothing but a huge
rambling hotel, with a number of “cottage”
dependencies. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Happy Valley.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The hotel company
has bought up the whole mountain-valley,
and runs it like a little
kingdom. It is a delightful place; the air fresh
and sparkling, the hotel and cottages sufficiently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>picturesque, the basin of the valley entirely given
up to the brilliant sward of the golf-course.
Around the hotel runs a spacious “piazza,” with
innumerable rocking-chairs. A score of buggies
and saddle-horses, at the disposition of the guests,
gather round the steps. Inside, every American
luxury is at command. You move noiselessly on
deep-piled carpets; the news-stand is heaped with
the latest magazines and novels; there is a little
row of shops where you can buy hats and frocks,
jewellery and bric-à-brac, at fifty per cent. over
Fifth-avenue prices; and—most indispensable
luxury of all—there is a stock- and share-broker’s
office, and there are long-distance telephones,
whereby you can keep in touch with Wall Street
and the various Exchanges. That curious oval
excrescence at one corner of the building is the
ballroom. It opens into the great hall of the
hotel, called “Peacock Walk”; for here the ladies
assemble after dinner to air their “rags” and
their diamonds.</p>

<p class='c001'>My friends chartered a buggy, and drove me
after lunch to Warm Springs, an old Colonial
health-resort, where it is on record that General
Washington came to nurse his gout; and thence
to a point called Flagstaff Hill, or something of
the sort, where we had a glorious view over an
endless stretch of hill-country, running far into
West Virginia. But, oh! the reckless, suicidal
waste of timber that is going on here, as almost
everywhere in America. Here, however, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>sheer thoughtlessness that is at work—not the
criminal cupidity which is converting the forests
of Maine and New Hampshire into wood-pulp,
and ruining for generations to come the climate,
the fertility, the water-power of the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our talk, of course, strays (not through my
leading) to the question of the negro.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Darkest Phase.</div>

<p class='c001'>“I have two cousins,” says Mrs.
X., “who are sisters. One of them
devotes all her spare money to the
amelioration of the black race, while personally
she loathes them and shrinks from them. The
other has no philanthropic feeling whatever; she
regrets that slavery was ever abolished; but she
likes the black people personally; she goes among
them, and nurses them when they are ill—just as
she would a favourite horse or dog. That is in
Philadelphia, where, as you know, I was born.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And you yourself—how do you feel on the
subject?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I had lived so much abroad that I had no
very definite feeling towards the black race, one
way or another, until a few summers ago, when I
spent some time at Aiken, South Carolina, where
the bulk of the population is black. I don’t think
I am hysterical, but I assure you it was an almost
intolerable sensation to walk down the main
street of Aiken, even at midday, under the eyes
of those hundreds of great hulking blacks, staring
at you with half-suppressed insolence. It gives
me a little shudder now to think of it.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“Last year,” said her husband, “I was shooting
in North Carolina, in a district where the
population is pretty evenly divided between white
and black. I boarded in a farmer’s family. The
grandfather had fought in the war, of course on
the Confederate side; the father and mother were
solid, unpretending, intelligent people. There
was a school-house only a mile and a half away,
but they could not let their two daughters go to
it. They could not let them stir away from home
unprotected. They had to pay for their education
at home, while at the same time they were being
taxed for the education of the negro children of
the district. That is not a pleasant state of
affairs.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Significant Admission.</div>

<p class='c001'>Some time afterwards, I stated this case to a
loading educator of negroes, a man widely recognized
as one of the best friends of
the race.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you think,” I asked him,
“that these girls could not safely have gone to
school? Or was their parents’ action the result
of groundless, or, at any rate, exaggerated, panic—as
of one who should forbid his children to pass
through a wood lest a tree should fall upon
them?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It would depend on the district,” was the
reply. “In some districts the girls could have
gone to school safely enough; in others, no!”</p>

<p class='c001'>This, I think, was a terrible admission; for,
after all, a “safe” district can only be one in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>which no outrage has occurred; and that is no
guarantee against its occurring to-morrow.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
What father, what husband, is going to rest on
such security?</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, then, I was face to face with the most
hideous factor in the problem—that which keeps
popular sentiment in the South chronically inflamed
and exasperated. Again and again, at
every turn, I came upon it; not only in the shape
of revolting stories, but in accounts of the constant
and most burdensome precautions which the state
of affairs imposes.</p>

<p class='c001'>To give only one instance: I asked an
American long resident in Havana whether there
was any trouble of this nature in Cuba. “No,”
he said, “practically none. It’s true that about
a year ago a sort of half-witted black was accused
of an outrage on a mulatto woman, and committed
suicide in prison to escape the garotte; but I believe
an American nigger has since confessed that he
was the real culprit. It’s very different,” he went
on, “in my native State, Louisiana. I have two
sisters married there. The husband of one of
them never dares to leave his home unless he
takes his wife with him. The husband of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>other is compelled to leave home for days at a
time; but he keeps a loaded shot-gun in every
room in the house, and he has made his wife
practice till she is a very fair shot, both with
gun and revolver. There isn’t a white man in
the country districts that doesn’t take similar
precautions.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Think what it means to have this nightmare
constantly present to the mind of every woman
and girl of a community—at any
rate in the country districts, and
on the outskirts of the towns. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Malign Enchantment.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> No
doubt the state of “nerves” it sets up is responsible
for many errors and cruelties. Many attempted
outrages may be purely imaginary. Negroes may
have been lynched or shot down, not only for
crimes they themselves did not commit, but for
crimes that were never committed at all.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> But
there are quite enough authentic cases of crime—denied
by nobody—to justify the horror of the
South.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> It is all very well to say that it is the
precautions taken, and most of all the lynchings,
that suggests the crime to vagrant, dissolute,
drink-and-drug-ruined negroes. That is probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>in great measure true—the evil moves in a vicious
circle. But who or what is to break the circle
of malign enchantment? Education? Yes, perhaps;
but education is at best a slow process.
I cannot to-day throw my revolver into the
Mississippi because I hope that fifty years hence
my grandson may have no use for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“During the war,” a very intelligent coloured
man said to me, “the planters’ wives and children
were left to the protection of the
negroes. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Who is to Blame?<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Not a single case of outrage
occurred, and scarcely a case of
theft or breach of trust. Had we been the
lecherous brutes we are now supposed to be, we
should have written the darkest page in history,
and brought the Southern armies home to the
defence of their own hearthstones.”</p>

<p class='c001'>That is true. It is admitted on every hand
that the conduct of the slaves during the war was,
on the whole, excellent, and in many cases
touchingly beautiful.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> And therein lies, by the
way, not, certainly, an apology for slavery, but
a proof that its most melodramatic horrors were
exceptional. But what matters the admission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>that the malignant and bestial negro did not exist
forty years ago, if it has to be admitted in the
same breath that he exists to-day?</p>

<p class='c001'>What has bred him? Who is responsible for
his existence? History may one day apportion
the burden between the doctrinaire self-righteousness
of the respectable North, the rascality of the
“carpet-bag” politician, the stiff-necked pride of
the South, and the vanity, the resentfulness, and
the savagery of the negro himself. But what
avails recrimination or apportionment of blame,
while the monstrous evil—none the less monstrous
because it necessarily awakens a morbid imagination
on both sides—exists and calls aloud to be
dealt with? While the relations of the two races
remain as they are, there can be no doubt that an
act of brutal lust often justifies itself to a semi-savage
imagination as an act of war—a racial
reprisal. And who shall say that a state of war
does not exist?</p>

<p class='c001'>Few sensible men in the South have now a
word to say for lynching.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> It has proved itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>as ineffectual in practice as it is unjustifiable
in theory. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Lynch Law.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It cannot even be palliated as an
ungovernable reaction of horror at the
particular atrocity here in question;
seeing that, as a matter of fact, more negroes are
lynched for mere murder than for outrages on
women.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> There seems to be little hope, however,
of a cessation of lynchings in the near future. The
Southern Press abounds with evidences that the
lynching impulse is strong, and is with difficulty
held in check<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> even when the provocation is
comparatively trifling.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>One thing seems to me certain—namely, that
crimes against women, and all sorts of negro crime,
will be far more effectually checked when respectable
and well-disposed negroes can feel reasonably
confident that people of their race will be treated
with common fairness in white courts of law. At
present it is certain that they can feel no such
confidence. But, in making this statement, I am
anticipating matters. The point is one to which
I must return later.</p>

<hr class='c014' />
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. In a paper read in 1901, Mr. A. H. Stone said of the Yazoo
Mississippi Delta: “There is now no more feeling of fear on the white
man’s part, whether for himself or his wife or his children, than in the
days of slavery.” But he afterwards added: “Writing to-day, 1908,
it would be necessary to modify this statement somewhat—certainly
for some part of this territory.” “The American Race Problem,”
p. 91. The footnotes to Mr. Stone’s paper point out one or two other
instances of a deterioration of conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. Among the “Causes Assigned” for lynchings in the statistical
statement prepared by the Chicago <cite>Tribune</cite>, “Race Prejudice” stands
fourth on the list; and in the four years, 1900-1903, twenty-four cases
are assigned to it. Among the other causes are “Unknown offences”
(10), “Mistaken Identity” (5), and “No offence” (1).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. “Making allowance for all exaggerations in attributing this
crime to negroes, there still remain enough well-authenticated cases of
brutal assault on women by black men in America to make every negro
bow his head in shame.”—<cite>Atlanta University Publications</cite>, No. IX. (A
negro monograph).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. “No race ever behaved better than the negro behaved during the
war. Not only were there no massacres and no outbreaks, but even
the amount of defection was not large.... Many a master going off
to the war entrusted his wife and children to the care of his servants
with as much confidence as if they had been of his own blood. They
acted rather like clansmen than like bondmen.... As Henry Grady
once said, ‘A thousand torches would have disbanded the Southern
army; but there was not one.’”—Thomas Nelson Page: “The Negro:
The Southerner’s Problem,” p. 21.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. One of the most sensible men in the South is certainly Mr. E. G.
Murphy, who writes (“The Present South,” p. 177): “The mob, so
far as it has a conscious philosophy, has attempted the justification of
its course upon these grounds: It has insisted that its methods were
necessary in order to prevent the crime; in order to avoid the procrastination
of the courts; and in order to protect the victim of assault
from the ordeal of presenting testimony at the trial of the offender. It
has become increasingly obvious, however, that the practice of lynching
... is not a remedy. It does not prevent crime. Through the
morbid interest which it arouses, and through the publicity which it
creates, it inflames to the utmost the power of criminal suggestion and
aggravates all the conditions of racial suspicion and antagonism. The
so-called ‘remedy’ has always been followed by new outbreaks of the
disease, the most atrocious crimes coming at short intervals after the
previous exercise of the mob’s philosophy of ‘prevention.’”  “Lynching
as a remedy,” says Mr. Thomas Nelson Page, “is a ghastly
failure.” The opposite opinion, however, has still its champions.
“The lynch lightning,” says Mr. W. B. Smith (an anti-negro
extremist), “seldom strikes twice in the same district or community.”
“The Colour-Line,” p. 259.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. The commonly accepted statistics of lynchings are those supplied
by the Chicago <cite>Tribune</cite>. I have before me the figures for the years
1885-1904, somewhat vitiated by the fact that the enumeration for 1888
is incomplete. It would appear that in these years 2942 lynchings in
all occurred, 2042 of the victims being negroes, and the remaining 900
belonging to other races. But the proportion of negro lynchings
steadily increased. In 1886, 71 negroes were lynched, as against 62
men of other races; whereas in 1901 the respective figures were 107
and 28. Out of the whole number of lynchings 25 per cent. were for
rape, 42 per cent. for murder, and 33 per cent. for other offences.
More than 80 per cent. of the whole number of lynchings occurred in
the Southern States.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>IV <br /> RHETORIC IN LOUISVILLE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Louisville, Kentucky, is not an attractive city. It
is as flat as my hand; its atmosphere is grimy;
its buildings vary from the commonplace to the
mean. It has one or two of the dumpy sky-scrapers—only
some ten or twelve storeys high—which
are indispensable to the self-respect of every
American city of a certain size; but one feels that
they are products of mere imitative ostentation,
not of economic necessity. In Louisville the
names, or numbers, of the streets are scarcely
ever stuck up. It is characteristic of a half-grown
American town that you can generally read
the names of streets which have no houses in
them; but when the houses are built, the name-boards
seem to be thrown away.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am apt to estimate the civilization of a city
by inspecting its book-stores; but during a long
day in Louisville I could not find a single one.
No doubt I failed to look in the right place; but
I certainly perambulated the leading business
streets. I was reminded of a couplet from I
know not what poet—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Alas for the South! Her books have grown fewer;</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Let me hasten to add that in all the other
cities I visited I found one or more fairly well-supplied
book-stores.</p>

<p class='c001'>For reasons I have elsewhere stated at length,
an American barber’s shop is an abomination
to me. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Tonsorial Sarcasm.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Among the least of its
terrors is the interminable time
occupied by the disgusting processes
to which you are submitted. However,
I had time on my hands in Louisville, and, being
a vagrant with no fixed abode, had no conveniences
for shaving myself. So I ventured into a “tonsorial
parlour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I was “attended” by a white “artist”; for
this is one of the trades from which the negro is
being rapidly ousted all over the South.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you special seats for coloured people in
the street-cars here”? I asked my torturer.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” he replied, “we haven’t. They can sit
wherever they please. And, what’s more, they
won’t sit beside each other, but insist on plumping
themselves down alongside of white folks. If <em>I</em>
had my way, they’d ride on the roof.” I need
scarcely remark that, as American street-cars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>have no outside seats, this was an ironical
recommendation.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was with some hesitancy that I offered a
tip to this champion of the dignity of the white
man. But he showed no resentment.</p>

<p class='c001'>I had been recommended to call on Mr. A. B.
Shipton (I alter the name), a coloured lawyer
of some prominence. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Negro Lawyer.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Entering his
office, I found a man of aquiline
features and tawny rather than
brown complexion, carrying on a conversation
through the telephone. From its matter I gathered
that he was talking to his wife; and this conjecture
was confirmed when he, so to speak, rang off with
two sounding kisses into the instrument. The
trait was characteristic; for the domestic negro
is very domestic indeed.</p>

<p class='c001'>He now put on his gold-rimmed eye-glasses
and read my letter of introduction, all the time
smoking a long pipe, which he had kept alight
even while at the telephone. I presently found
that some of his habits in relation to the use of
tobacco savoured of the period of “Martin Chuzzlewit”;
but he was a man whom one instinctively,
and with no effort, met on the equal terms on
which one would meet a member of his profession
in England.</p>

<p class='c001'>As I was well accredited, he received me with
cordiality and talked freely. Not only freely,
indeed, but copiously; not only copiously, but
with rhetorical finish and emphasis. I soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>realized that I was listening to extracts from
speeches which he was in the habit of delivering.</p>

<p class='c001'>Looking back upon the whole tenor of our
interview, I find it curiously like the talk which
a sixteenth-century Englishman might have held
with a Spanish or Venetian Jew. Mr. Shipton
related, indeed, a series of wrongs, injustices, and
humiliations; but the ever-recurring burden of
his tale was a celebration of the material progress
of his race, the wealth they were amassing, the
homes they were founding, the heroism they were
developing in the teeth of adverse circumstance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Plaint of the Uncomplaining.</div>

<p class='c001'>“As you go southward, sir,” he said, “people
will tell you over and over again that they, the
Southern whites, alone know the
negro and know how to deal with
him. That is precisely the reverse
of the truth. They do not know the negro,
because they won’t know him. They won’t
enter into any sympathetic relation with him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was different in the days of slavery, no
doubt. Then, in most cases, there was a certain
amount of human intercourse between the slave
and the master. But the growing white generation
has no approach to the knowledge of the
black man (to say nothing of sympathy with him)
that its grandfathers had in ante-bellum days.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is race-prejudice weakening at all? It is
not weakening, but altering, and that in an
ominous way. Thirty years ago the prejudice
was against the ignorant, shiftless and thriftless

those, in a word, who come into competition
with the middle-class white.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Just think, sir, what we have done! Forty
years ago, when slavery came to an end, we were
four million ignorant, homeless, schoolless, friendless
creatures. Now there are ten millions of us,
and we have a hundred colleges, thousands of
schools, tens of thousands of homes. We pay
taxes on a billion dollars’ worth of property.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Forty years ago we had no business men, no
professional men. Now we have painters, poets,
architects, inventors, merchants, lawyers, doctors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>divines. And yet we are shut off from the body-politic.
We have to submit to taxation without
representation. Even those of us who cannot be
defrauded of our votes are excluded from the
councils of the party which would not exist
without us. That” (with peculiar bitterness) “is
what they call the lilywhite policy!<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“But, sir, we are uncomplaining. If there is
a colour-problem, it is not we who raise it. No!
it is the unprincipled white politician who finds
anti-negro agitation a popular plank in his
platform.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Even under this government of the two
races by and for the one race, the negro is loyal
to the country which he has enriched by his
labour, hallowed by his graves, watered with his
blood.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We are a docile and an instinctively religious
race. You will find few negro atheists or infidels.
We are susceptible to any and all of the forms of
the Christian religion. We are Methodists or
Baptists among the Methodists and Baptists,
Presbyterians among the Presbyterians, Episcopalians
among the Episcopalians, Roman Catholics
among the Roman Catholics.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I could not but think this remark significant
of much—of far more, indeed, than the speaker
realized.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Are you excluded from municipal as well as
from political life?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“Even more strictly, if possible,” was the
reply. “All municipal offices are in the hands
of ‘sho’ ’nuff white folks,’ though they may be
Dagos, or Germans, or Slavs. Of course the city
government and the police department are run by
the Irish. No negro holds a job higher than that
of washing spittoons in the Court House. Yet in
this city we pay taxes on three millions of property.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Arithmetical Progression.</div>

<p class='c001'>“But this is the saving trait of the negro’s
character: shut off from all other activities, he
goes on quietly and uncomplainingly
working, educating himself,
and accumulating property.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> For
the righting of our wrongs we must look
to the negroes in those States where they hold
the balance of power—in Ohio, Indiana, Connecticut,
New Jersey, and others. And think what
an element we are destined to form in the
body politic! In fifty years we shall be twenty-five
millions; next century we shall be fifty
millions. Not a drop of our blood is lost to us—the
whites take care of <em>that</em>. If you haven’t got
but a sixteenth part of black blood, you’re a negro
all right.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Twenty-five millions in fifty years! Next
century fifty millions! I did think of it; and it
was a thought to give one pause. Perhaps a
more careful estimate would somewhat reduce the
figures. Cautious statisticians, proceeding on the
best available data, place the probable number of
negroes at the beginning of the next century
somewhere about 35,000,000—that is to say, some
10,000,000 more than the whole population of the
eighteen Southern States at last census.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As I left Mr. Shipton I asked whether his
practice was mainly among his own people.
“Yes,” he said; “ninety nine per cent. of it;
though, by-the-by, I got divorces for a couple of
white men the other day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And now a word of amends to Louisville. An
hour before sunset I took a car down all the long
length of Broad Street, till it landed
me at the entrance to Shawnee
Park. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>An Idyll.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This expanse of lush and yet delicate
verdure is embraced by a bend of the majestic
Ohio. The steep banks of the river are nobly
wooded, and you look across the splendid sheet
of water to what might be primeval forest beyond.
In that soft sunset hour, the air was full of the
scent of flowering shrubs. A mocking-bird was
singing in a thicket; far off I heard voices
of children playing, and, on the river, the clunk
of a pair of oars in rowlocks; but within sight
there were only two lovers on a grassy mound,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>and a student bent over his book. As the sun
touched the trees of the opposite bank and threw
a glow over the yellow eddies of the great river,
I thought it would be hard to picture a more
peaceful, a more beautiful, a more idyllic scene.
So even Louisville is not without its charms.</p>

this point, however, a wise word of Mr. E. G. Murphy’s deserves to be
noted: “If the man who ‘disappears’ as a barber reappears as a
carpenter, or as a small farmer on his own land, he may figure in the
census-tables to prove all sorts of dismal theories; but, as a matter of

crime? No, not that they fear negro crime less, but that they fear
negro ambition and success more. They can deal with crime by chain-gang

<p class='c001'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. According to Mr. W.H. Thomas, a negro writer violently hostile
to his race, negroes in the year 1901 owned about $700,000,000, and
paid state and municipal taxes of over $3,000,000. This, he reckons,
would mean property to the amount of about $90 per head, or a saving
of about $2·60 (ten and sixpence) per head per year since emancipation.
Mr. Thomas also states that before the war there was in the
South a free negro population of a quarter of a million, owning between
thirty-five and forty million dollars’ worth of property. “The
American Negro,” pp. 39 and 74. Mr. Thomas Nelson Page also
points out that some negroes accumulated wealth during the Reconstruction
period “by other means than those of honest thrift.” But it
is probable that in most cases the money thus gained was not so
employed as to constitute a permanent addition to the wealth of
the race.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'>“DISCRIMINATION” IN MEMPHIS</p>

<p class='c010'>A night’s railway journey on the Illinois Central
carries you from Louisville to Memphis, Tennessee,
and from the Ohio to the Mississippi. You strike
the Father of Waters some time before you reach
Memphis. Here two sets of literary associations
were awakened in my mind. We passed through
miles of swampy, malarial-looking forests, with
snake-like vines binding the trees together; and
every here and there would come a clearing on
the river-bank, still bristling with huge gaunt
stumps of dead timber, and showing a melancholy
cabin or two, which forcibly recalled the Eden of
“Martin Chuzzlewit.” And then, again, in some
quiet backwater, we would see a great raft of
lumber, with a hut or tent on it—the very raft
of Huckleberry Finn and Jim. So strongly have
the great rivers always appealed to my imagination
that the first thing I did in Memphis was to go
down to the wharf and ascertain whether I could
not travel at least part of the way to New Orleans
by steamer. There are plenty of huge sternwheel
boats, still on the river; but alas! their movements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>are not arranged in view of passenger traffic.
Only in short stages, and at great expenditure
of time, could I have carried out my ambition.
Baffled at Memphis, I still hoped to take boat
from Vicksburg to Natchez; but I found that
I should have to wait two days for a boat, and
should then spend two more days in covering a
distance which I could do by rail in a single night.
So, except for a short excursion at New Orleans,
I did not go a-sailing on the waters of the
Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c001'>Memphis is a much brighter, cleaner, more
alert and prosperous-looking place than Louisville.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Charity and Colour.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
There are shops on Main Street that
would make a good figure in Paris;
and at night it is as gay with
electricity as the “Great White Way” of New
York. When I arrived, Memphis was evidently
in the thick of some excitement. The side-walks
of Main Street were crowded with ladies, young
and—less young, who were making dashes at
every male passer-by, and seeking to pin a square
purple badge to the lapel of his coat. It was soon
evident that life was not worth living unless you
wore one of these badges; so I secured one, at the
expense of half-a-dollar, and on examining it
found that it was inscribed—“Tag-Day for the
Tennessee Home for Incurables.” This was, in
fact, a sort of Hospital Saturday, and the tag
pinned to your coat was a certificate that you
had paid up.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>The system struck me as ingenious; but it
is because of a significant sequel that I mention
it. In the afternoon, I called on a negro professional
man who had invited me to go for a drive
in his buggy. As we left the house I noticed that
he wore no tag. I touched my own tag, and said,
smiling, “Dare you venture into the streets
without one of these?” “Why,” he replied,
“they wouldn’t for anything ‘tag’ a coloured
man!”</p>

<p class='c001'>This was “discrimination” with a vengeance!
Even charity fenced round by the colour-line! I
felt that here at last I had touched the limit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“Free” Libraries.</div>

<p class='c001'>We drove past the small but attractive-looking
Public Library, situated on a bluff,
with a glorious view over the lake-like
Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is there discrimination here?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, certainly,” was the reply. “My son
is in an office where several of the white young
men have cards enabling them to draw books from
the library. My son applied for a card; and as
he is very light in colour, it at first seemed that
there was going to be no difficulty. But when
they heard his name, they identified him as my
son and refused him a card. The librarian wrote
to me privately, and said that the boy could have
as many books as he liked without any card. But
I would not have that; I threatened to take the
case into court by refusing to pay any tax for the
support of the library. But then they offered to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>establish a branch library for coloured people, and
that compromise I accepted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Some time later, in another city, I was
reminded of this conversation on seeing a very
handsome Carnegie Free Library occupying a
prominent site.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it free to coloured people?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh dear no,” was the reply. “Carnegie
offered to give an extra $10,000 for a black branch
library, if the town would contribute $1000 a year
to its support. This the town agreed to do, on
condition that the negro community provided the
site. We, on our part, consented to this, merely
stipulating that we should have a voice in the
management. The town replied emphatically
‘No,’ and the whole thing fell through. It
would simply have meant, you see, that they
would have dumped upon us any rubbish for
which they hadn’t room in the main library.
Can you wonder that we declined?” I could
not.</p>

<p class='c001'>To return to Memphis. I had gone there, not
exactly to attend the annual “Conference for
Education in the South,” but to see
several people who were attending it.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Educators in Council.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> However, I did go to one or two
meetings, and notably to one which was to be
addressed by the British Ambassador, Mr. James
Bryce. It was in the Lyceum Theatre, and I sat on
the platform (the stage) and looked out over the
crowded house, where a dozen electric fans were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>keeping the sultry air in motion. It seemed to
me odd that, while the floor of the house and the
first and second circle were overcrowded, there
were only one or two people in the gallery.
Presently I looked up again; there were now
about twenty people in the upper regions, and
I had a curious difficulty in distinguishing their
features. A light burst upon me—they were
negroes. In a “Conference for Education in the
South” the whites did all the conferring and the
blacks, if they were so minded, might listen from
the gallery.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next day my black, or rather olive-coloured,
friend said: “I could have whipped myself this
morning when I opened the paper and saw that
I’d missed hearing Bryce. I was bent upon hearing
him, but somehow I forgot that yesterday was
the evening.” I wondered whether he realized
that he would have had to sit in the gallery. But
I did not ask him. Every now and then, in this
country, one turns tail and flees from the haunting
colour question. It is the skeleton at the feast
of Southern life.</p>

<p class='c001'>In New York I had met President Booker
T. Washington, of Tuskegee, one of the most
notable men in America, an accomplished speaker,
and an authority, if ever there was one, on the
education of the negro. “No doubt I shall see
you at Memphis,” I said, in an off-hand way. He
answered, rather drily, “No;” and some time
afterwards he said, “You asked me if I would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>at Memphis—I am not at all sure that I should
be welcome there. I received a printed circular
notifying me of the meeting, but no invitation to
attend it. You will find friends of the negro
there, and of negro education—oh yes, plenty.
But they will not be of my colour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I did, as a matter of fact, hear one friend of
negro education hold forth—Bishop Bratton, of
Mississippi. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Bishop on Race Equality.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The Bishop laid down a
good many principles—among them
that “the negro is capable of development
to a point whose limit he (the speaker) had
not discovered,” but that “the vast majority
are still children intellectually, and little short of
savages morally.” The purport of his address was
the assertion that negro education should not be left
entirely or mainly to negro teachers. The ideal
school would be one under the supervision of a
white clergyman, where carefully selected portions
of Scripture should be necessary parts of the
curriculum, and “where the race should be taught
that race integrity is obedience to God’s own
creation and appointment, and that race intercourse,
kindly and cordial, is not race equality.”
“Indeed,” the Bishop proceeded, “the very expression
‘race equality’ is an anachronism belonging
to the mediæval period of reconstruction
history [that is, roughly, the period between 1866
and 1876], which has long gone to its account.”
These remarks were warmly received by the
audience, and greatly applauded by the leading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Southern papers. But one understands why Mr.
Booker T. Washington—and, still more, why Professor
W. E. B. Du Bois, of Atlanta University—were
not bidden to the conference. Of these two
negro leaders I shall try to give a sketch in my
next paper.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>VI <br /> TWO LEADERS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“People are always laying stress on the white
blood in me,” said Mr. W. E. Burghardt Du Bois,
“and attributing to that anything I do that is
worth doing. But they never speak of the white
blood in Mr. Booker Washington, who, as a
matter of fact, has a larger share than I have.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How do you make that out?” I asked; and
Mr. Du Bois gave me the story of his ancestry.
The story went back two hundred years, for he
comes of a New England stock, and has had no
slave ancestors (I take it) for many generations.
I could not follow his proof that more of Africa
flows in his veins than in Mr. Booker Washington’s;
nor does it greatly matter; for if it be so in
fact, Nature has taken great pains to conceal the
fact, and the popular error of which he complains
is practically inevitable.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Contrast of Personalities.</div>

<p class='c001'>Principal Booker T. Washington is a negro in
every lineament, and not, one would
say, of the most refined type. His
skin is neither black nor copper-coloured,
but rather of a sort of cloudy yellow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>to which the other shades are, perhaps, æsthetically
preferable. His hair, his ears, his nose,
his jaw, all place his race beyond dispute;
only his grave, candid, forceful eyes announce
a leader of men. He is above middle height,
and heavily built; seated, he is apt to sprawl.
He has a curious trick of drawing back the
corners of his mouth, so as to reveal almost the
whole of his range of teeth. At first I took
this for a slow smile, heralding some humorous
remark; but humour is not Mr. Washington’s
strong point. His grin is a nervous habit, and
scarcely a pretty one.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Altogether, in talking
with him, you have no difficulty in remembering
the race of your interlocutor, and if you make
an untactful remark—if you let the irrepressible
instinct of race-superiority slip out—you have
all the more reason to be ashamed.</p>

<p class='c001'>With Mr. Du Bois the case is totally different.
His own demonstration notwithstanding, I cannot
believe that there is more of the negro in him
than in (say) Alexandre Dumas fils. Meeting
this quiet, cultivated, French-looking gentleman,
with his pointed beard, olive complexion, and
dark melancholy eyes, it is hard to believe that
he is born, as he himself phrases it, “within the
Veil.” In appearance he reminded me a good
deal of Gabriele d’Annunzio, only that D’Annunzio
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>happens to be fair, while Mr. Du Bois has something
more like the average Italian complexion.
In speaking to this man of fine academic culture—this
typical college don, one would have said—the
difficulty was to feel any difference of race
and traditions, and not to assume, tactlessly, an
identical standpoint.</p>

<p class='c001'>These two men are unquestionably the leaders
of their race to-day; but their ideals and their
policy are as different as their physique. Mr.
Washington leads from within; Mr. Du Bois from
without. Should he read this phrase he will
probably resent it; but it may be none the less
true. Mr. Washington could never have been
anything else than a negro; he represents all that
is best in the race, but nothing that is not in the
race. Mr. Du Bois is a negro only from outside
pressure. I do not mean, of course, that there
are no negro traits in his character, but that it is
outside pressure—the tyranny of the white man—that
has made him fiercely, passionately, insistently
African. Had there been no colour question—had
the negro had no oppression, no injustice to
complain of—Mr. Du Bois would have been a
cosmopolitan, and led the life of a scholar at some
English, German, or perhaps even American
University. As it was, he felt that to desert his
race would be the basest of apostasies; but it was
because he could have been disloyal that he
became so vehemently—one might almost say
fanatically—loyal.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>I have heard a well-known New York publicist,
the editor of an influential paper, express the
opinion that Mr. Booker Washington
is one of the greatest men at
present alive in America. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“Up from Slavery.”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> One of
the others was President Eliot, of Harvard; the
third I will not name—thus leaving the gate of
hope ajar for many eminent persons. There was,
perhaps, a spice of paradox in this appraisement
of Mr. Washington; but a remarkable man he
certainly is. Not, I think, a great intellect, but
assuredly a strong and admirable character. His
life, as related by himself in “Up from Slavery,”
is a story of quiet heroism to rank with any in
literature. Born a slave in a one-room cabin,
with no glazed window and an earthen floor, he
remained there until, when he was eight or nine,
emancipation came. After that he worked in a
salt-furnace and in a coal-mine, devoured all the
time by a passion for knowledge which overcame
what seemed almost incredible difficulties. At
last he set forth for Hampton Institute, where
General Armstrong was then just beginning
his beneficent work. He had five hundred miles
to travel and scarcely any money. He worked
and even begged his way; for Mr. Washington
has never been ashamed to beg when there was
a good object to be served. Arriving at Richmond,
Virginia, without a cent, he worked for several
days unloading a ship, and slept at night in a
hollow under a wooden side-walk.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>At Hampton he found the system in operation
which he has since adopted at Tuskegee—namely,
that tuition is covered by endowment, while the
student is enabled to pay (in part, at any rate) by
work, for his board and clothing. He soon distinguished
himself, not by great attainments, but
by the thoroughness of his work and the sincerity
and elevation of his character. Then, in 1881,
it occurred to the State of Alabama to start a
normal school for coloured people at a little
village named Tuskegee, some forty miles from
the capital, Montgomery. It did not, however,
occur to the State of Alabama to provide any
buildings or apparatus; it simply allotted £400
a year to be applied to the salaries of the
teachers. On General Armstrong’s recommendation,
Mr. Washington, then a youth of some five-and-twenty,
was entrusted with the organization
and management of the school; and the account
of how, with practically no resources at all, he
built up the great and beneficent institution
which has now made the name of Tuskegee
world-famous, is indeed a remarkable story of
indomitable courage and perseverance. Mr.
Washington felt that his personal failure would
be reckoned a failure for his race. Out of the
nettle, danger, he plucked the flower, safety;
and Tuskegee now represents perhaps the
greatest individual triumph his race has ever
achieved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course it has been achieved largely through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>philanthropic help from the North—Mr. Washington,
as I have said, is an unashamed, though very
tactful, beggar. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Statesman or Time-Server?<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is precisely that
tactfulness, in its largest sense, with
which the fierier spirits of his race
reproach him. In their milder moods they call
him an opportunist and time-server; in moments
of irritation they call him a betrayer of his
people, and a pitiful truckler to the white man.
He is, in fact, nothing of the sort; on the
wrongs of his race he has spoken with no
uncertain voice, when he felt it to be in season;
but he has not harped upon them in and out
of season. While he has plenty of race-pride,
he has no race-vanity, and realizes that the negro
has yet to conquer his place among the fully-developed
and civilized races of the world. To
help in this conquest is the mission and glory
of his life; and he feels, rightly or wrongly, that
material progress must precede and serve as a
basis for intellectual progress. Therefore what
is called the academic course—the course of
language, literature, and abstract science—plays
only a secondary part at Tuskegee. The curriculum
is mainly industrial and agricultural, though
the chemical and mechanical theory which lies
behind agriculture and the handicrafts is by no
means neglected. The fostering of aptitudes and
the upbuilding of character—these are the two
great aims of Tuskegee. The negro, says Mr.
Washington, must render himself necessary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>the American Commonwealth before he can expect
to take a highly esteemed place in it, and the
best way to claim a vote is to show that you are
capable of using it wisely. Such are the maxims
which he inculcates on his students—thereby
earning the contumely of the fierier spirits aforesaid.
They broke up one of his meetings in
Boston, not long ago, with red pepper, and with
the racial weapon—the razor.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if any one imagines that Mr. Washington
is a saint-like spirit in whom the wrongs of his
race awaken no bitterness, he is very much mistaken.
He has, when he cares to show it, a
quiet contempt for the pettinesses of Southern
policy which is rendered all the more scathing
by his acceptance of them as matters of course.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was at the Atlanta Exposition of 1895
that Mr. Booker Washington made his first great
success—the success which brought
him national renown as a speaker
and a leader of his race. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Atlanta Compromise.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In an
address delivered at the opening ceremony, he
formulated what has since become famous as
the Atlanta Compromise, in this oft-quoted
sentence: “In all things that are purely social
we can be as separate as the fingers, yet one
as the hand in all things essential to mutual
progress.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Washington has himself described with
dignified simplicity the enthusiasm which this
speech aroused among an audience which, if not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>hostile at the outset, was at least sceptical of the
policy of allowing a negro to speak on such an
occasion. The chairman—the Governor of Georgia—rushed
across the platform and shook him by
the hand, and the country was soon ringing with
the fame of his tactful eloquence. But though
it is the phrase above quoted that has become
classic, there was another, which, if I am not
greatly mistaken, did more to conciliate his
audience. Speaking of the progress of his race,
as manifested in their department of the Exposition,
he reminded his hearers that the negro
had “started thirty years ago with ownership
here and there in a few quilts and pumpkins and
chickens (gathered from miscellaneous sources).”
I would wager a good deal that it was this
parenthesis, this genial allusion to the tender
topic of chicken-stealing, that finally won the
hearts of his white hearers. It is impossible
to imagine Mr. Du Bois thus playing, not to
the gallery, but rather to the stalls. And Mr.
Washington no doubt deliberately calculated his
effect, for he is certainly not by nature an irrepressibly
facetious personage.</p>

<p class='c001'>This famous speech, with its famous metaphor,
was delivered, as I have said, at Atlanta, in 1895.
At Atlanta in 1906 an outbreak of popular frenzy,
excited by one or two real and several imaginary
outrages, led to the slaughter in the streets of
an unknown number of negroes (probably thirty
or forty), not one of whom was even suspected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>of any crime. It does not seem as though the
Atlanta Compromise had as yet borne much fruit,
at any rate on its native soil.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even more significant than Mr. Washington’s
“Up from Slavery” is a book called “Tuskegee
and its People,” to which he contributes
a general introduction. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Tuskegee Ideals.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Two-thirds of the book consist of
“Autobiographies by Graduates of the School,”
with such titles as “A College President’s Story,”
“A Lawyer’s Story,” “The Story of a Blacksmith,”
“The Story of a Farmer,” “A Druggist’s
Story,“ “A Negro Community Builder.” These
stories are all interesting, many of them heroic
and touching, and all permeated with the Booker-Washington
spirit of indomitable self-help, unresentful
acceptance of outward conditions, and
unquestioning measurement of success by material
standards. And yet not wholly material. The
formation and maintenance of the “home” are
the aspiration and ideal everywhere proclaimed—the
home connoting, to the negro mind, not
only pecuniary well-being, but decency, morality,
education, a certain standard of refinement. Here
is a characteristic passage from “The Story of
a Farmer”:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>Rev. Robert C. Bedford, Secretary of the board of
trustees, Tuskegee Institute, some time ago visited us....
He wrote the following much-appreciated compliment
regarding our homes and ourselves: “The homes of the
Reid brothers are very nicely furnished throughout.
Everything is well kept and very orderly. The bedspreads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>are strikingly white, and the rooms—though I called when
not expected—were in the best of order.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>To this subject of the “home” I shall return
later. I have seen few things more touching
than the negro’s pride in the whiteness of his
bedspreads.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not less characteristic, however, is this further
passage from the same “Story of a Farmer,”
which follows, indeed, on the same page:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>Under the guidance of the Tuskegee influences ... the
importance of land-buying was early brought to our attention,
but because of the crude and inexperienced labourers
about us, we found that we could, with advantage to all,
rent large tracts of land, sub-rent to others, and in
this way pay no rent ourselves, as these sub-renters did
that for us. We could in this way also escape paying
taxes, insurance, and other expenses that naturally
follow.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>It does not appear that “the Tuskegee influence”
involves any economic idealism, or any
doubt as to the legitimacy of capitalistic exploitation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Principal Washington’s message, by his own
admission, or, rather, insistence, might not unfairly
be called “The Gospel of the
Toothbrush.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Washingtonian Optimism.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Again and again he
uses this unpretending appliance as a
symbol of the clean-living self-respect which he has
made an ideal for his race. His policy, as he puts
it in a remarkable passage, is to teach the negro to
“want more wants.” It is the man with scarcely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>any wants who can satisfy them by working one
day a week and loafing the other six. The man
who wants many things “to make a happy fireside
clime for weans and wife,” is the man who can
be trusted to work steadily for six days out of the
seven. This undeniable and (from the employer’s
point of view) most salutary truth ought to put to
silence the dwindling minority of Southerners who
still object to the very idea and principle of negro
education.</p>

<p class='c001'>But suppose the majority of the race converted
either into men of independent substance or
satisfactory labourers for hire, will the problem be
thereby solved? Principal Washington has no
doubt on the subject. In the introduction to
“Tuskegee and its People,” he proclaims his
optimism in no uncertain voice:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>The immeasurable advancement of the negro, manifested
in character, courage, and cash ... is “confirmation
strong as proofs of Holy Writ” that the gospel of
industry, as exemplified by Tuskegee and its helpers, has
exerted a leavening influence upon civilization wherever it
has been brought within the reach of those who are
struggling towards the heights. Under this new dispensation
of mind, morals, and muscle, with the best whites
and best blacks in sympathetic co-operation, and justice
meaning the same to the weak as to the strong, the South
will no longer be vexed by a race problem.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Such is the teaching of Washingtonian
optimism.</p>

<p class='c001'>And what is the reply of Du Boisian idealism?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>The reply is implicit in the very title of Mr.
Du Bois’ book, “The Souls of Black Folk.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Du Boisian Idealism.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Your
method of securing peace, decency,
and comfort for our bodies,” say
the idealists to Mr. Washington,
“implies, even if successful, the degradation and
atrophy of our souls.” Mr. Du Bois celebrates
with fervour the saints, the rebels, and the
martyrs of his race, of whom Mr. Washington
seems never to have heard. Mr. Du Bois admits,
of course, the misfortunes of his people, but
apparently regards them as a pure contrariety of
Fate, with nothing in the racial constitution or
character to account for them. Nothing less than
the most perfect equality, not only economic and
political, but social and intellectual, will satisfy
him. If the negro is to hold a place apart, it
must be by his own free choice, because he does
not desire or condescend to mingle with the white.
“Those who dislike amalgamation,” he says,
“can best prevent it by helping to raise the negro
to such a plane of intelligence and economic
independence that he will never stoop to mingle
his blood with those who despise him.” Mr.
Washington admits to the full the mistakes of
the Reconstruction Period—when the negro was
made the dominant race in the South—and
promises that they shall never be repeated. For
Mr. Du Bois the mistake lay in not resolutely
carrying through (of course, with greater wisdom
and purity of purpose) the Reconstruction policy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>He sees no reason why “the vision of ‘forty acres
and a mule’—the righteous and reasonable
ambition to become a landowner, which the nation
had all but categorically promised to the freedmen”—should
not have been literally realized.
In short, while Mr. Washington is an opportunist
and a man of action, Mr. Du Bois is a cloistered
intransigeant.</p>

<p class='c001'>But especially does he resent the over-emphasis
laid, as he thinks, on manual as opposed to intellectual
training. Manual training is good; but
without intellectual training it must leave the
race on a low and servile level; and Mr. Washington’s
“deprecation of institutions of higher learning,”
is leading to a “steady withdrawal of aid”
from negro universities. The spectacle of a “lone
black boy poring over a French grammar amid the
weeds and dirt of a neglected home,” which
raised in Mr. Washington only a pitying smile,
seems to Mr. Du Bois heroic and admirable. The
“gospel of work and money,” he thinks, “threatens
almost completely to overshadow the higher aims
of life.” “To seek to make the blacksmith
a scholar is almost as silly as the more modern
scheme of making the scholar a blacksmith;
almost, but not quite.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I have paused in the story of my pilgrimage in
order to give a little sketch of two conflicting
tendencies, embodied in two remarkable men.
Mr. Washington I have called an optimist; but it
must not be understood that Mr. Du Bois is wholly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>a pessimist. He even says in one place: “That
the present social separation and acute race-sensitiveness
must eventually yield to the influence
of culture, as the South grows civilized, is clear.”
But is it? I wish I could share the confidence of
either the optimist or the idealist.</p>
<hr class='c014' />
<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. Since writing this, I have heard Mr. Washington make a speech,
and now conceive this grin to be partly, at any rate, a habit contracted
in the effort to secure perfectly clear enunciation.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>VII <br /> A WHITE TYPE AND A BLACK</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In Memphis I had no difficulty in discovering
what I had in vain looked for in Louisville—a
book-store. There are two or three on Main
Street; and into one of them I went to ask for
Mr. Du Bois’s book, “The Souls of Black Folk,”
which I had not yet read.</p>

<p class='c001'>Immediately the proprietor swooped down
upon me. As to the possession of that particular
book he returned an evasive answer; but if I
wanted information about the negro, I had, in
every sense, come to the right shop. He exuded
information at every pore. He had no prejudice
against the negro—no, not he! Why, he employed
three or four of them on his own place. (This
protestation of impartiality I found to be the
constant exordium of such a tirade.) But he was
simply stating a matter of incontrovertible fact
when he said that there was no nigger that would
not assault a white woman whenever he saw a
chance of doing so with impunity.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But,” I objected, “outrages are not, after all,
such daily occurrences. Do you mean to suggest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>that there are many outrages and lynchings that
are never heard of—that don’t get into the
newspapers?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh no; they get into the papers right
enough. The reason there aren’t more outrages
is simply that we whites have learnt to protect
ourselves against the negro, just as we do against
the yellow fever and the malaria—the work of
noxious insects. You’re at the Hotel Gayoso, are
you? Well, you see the wire-gauze screens over
all the doors and windows? That’s to keep out
the muskeeters; and just in the same way we
must keep the nigger out of our lives.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An Impartial Philosopher.</div>

<p class='c001'>Then came a phrase which I was to hear
repeated many times, not by irresponsible fanatics,
but by Southerners of a much higher
type: “I tell you, sir, no pen can
describe the horrors of the Reconstruction
Period, when all that was best in the
white South was outlawed, and the nigger rode
roughshod over us. The true story of that time
will never be written in history. It is known only
to those who went through it.”<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>He then poured forth in terms of romantic
extravagance the tale of the Ku-Klux-Klan, and
how it had saved American civilization. He referred
me, by way of proof, to the statue of General
Forrest, right here in Memphis, who had been
Grand Titan, or Grand Dragon, or I know not
what, of the said organization, and whom British
soldiers, General French and General Wolseley,
had declared to have been the greatest military
genius that ever lived.</p>

<p class='c001'>To all this I was no unwilling listener; yet my
time was limited, and now and then I sought to
return to the prime object of my visit. In vain!
He literally button-holed me, held me by the lapel
of my coat, while he informed me that there was
not an honest woman, in any sense of the word,
among the whole negro race, and that the
coloured population was ravaged by every sort
of vice and disease. Had it been possible to take
his assurances literally, one must have concluded
that the race problem must quickly solve itself
by the extinction of the negro. And he frankly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>looked forward to that consummation. “Our
vagrancy laws are going to be a bitter pill for
them. You see”—here he sketched a diagram to
assist my understanding—“a nigger can’t come
here to the front-door of my house and ring the
bell; but he can go round to the back door”—a
line represented his tortuous course—“and I tell
you he does. Every household supports at least
four or five niggers. Now the vagrancy laws are
going to drive that class of niggers to the North,
and the Yankee ain’t goin’ to stand his ways.
We’re a long-sufferin’ people here in the South.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As for Mr. Du Bois’s book, it was evident that,
even if he had it, he was not going to sell it to
me. I left the shop with two books: one was
“The Clansman,” by Thomas Dixon, jun., a melodramatic
romance of the Ku-Klux-Klan; the other
a pseudo-scientific onslaught on the negro race—a
brutal and disgusting volume.</p>

<p class='c001'>An hour or two later I was sitting in the
consulting-room or “office” of a coloured physician—Dr.
Oberman, let me call
him. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Doctor’s Story.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>His real name was that of a
we ll-known Southern family, and I
remarked upon the fact, expecting to hear that he
had been born a slave in that family. In a sense
this was the case; but his story was a strange
one, and he told it with frank simplicity.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My father,” he said, “was in fact a member
of that family”—and he told of sundry political
offices which his white kindred had filled.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“But my father attached himself openly and
honourably to my mother, who was a slave in the
family, and for that reason had to leave his home
in North Carolina. For some reason or other
they chose to go to the State of Mississippi. In
1850 that was a long and toilsome journey; and
I was born on the way, not far from this place.
For some years they lived in Mississippi, but they
were again driven from there and passed into Ohio.
My father was one of the noblest of men, and as
soon as he was in a State where he could legally
do so, he married my mother. I was present at
the wedding.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your mother, Dr. Oberman,” I said, “must
surely have been a quadroon, or even an
octoroon?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear mother,” he said, “was very nearly
of the same colour as myself. You see, sir, we
don’t breed straight,”—and he proceeded to give
several instances in which the children either of
two people of mixed blood, or of a white father and
a mother of mixed blood, had varied very widely
in complexion and facial type, some seeming
almost pure white, others emphatically negroid.
I did not say it, but I could not help thinking:
This is scarcely a point in favour of that mixing
of bloods which is here called miscegenation. Or
is it merely another form of race-prejudice to hold
that marriage undesirable in which the colour of
the offspring cannot be foretold, and is apt to
be variegated?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“Miscegenation.”</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>In a country where such terrible disabilities
and humiliations await those in whom there is
the slightest strain of black blood,
it is surely manifest that the people
who impose these humiliations, and
scout the idea of legal marriage between the races,
ought to visit with the severest penalties any
relation (necessarily illicit) between a white man
and a coloured woman—any augmentation by the
white man of that half-bred caste on which colour-disabilities
press with such peculiar cruelty. I
asked Dr. Oberman whether there was any
adequate feeling of this sort in the white community—whether
the white man who was known
to have relations with coloured women was
denounced and ostracised?</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear sir,” he replied, “I can assure you
that many of those who preach most loudly against
miscegenation are far from practising what they
preach.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I am glad to say, however, that white men
everywhere assured me that there was a strong
and increasingly efficient public sentiment against
this most anti-social form of transgression.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>cannot but think that the lynching of a few white
men notoriously guilty of it would beneficially
equalize matters.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“Our Moses.”</div>

<p class='c001'>As I had come to Dr. Oberman with an
introduction from Mr. Booker Washington, it
was natural that the talk should fall
upon the comparative merits of
academic and of industrial education for the
negro. Said the doctor: “We acquire property,
and we want bankers; we fall ill, and we want
physicians; we have business difficulties, and
we want lawyers; we have souls, and we want
preachers who can give us something better than
the old ranting theology. But for every one of
our race who can profit by a literary education,
there are ninety-nine for whom manual training is
the first essential.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then, looking up at a portrait of Mr. Washington
on the wall of his office, he said, “Ah! he is
our Moses!”</p>

<p class='c001'>But a stronger proof of the reverence with
which this leader is regarded awaited me as I left
Dr. Oberman’s house. I had gone some twenty
yards down the street, when I fancied I heard my
name called. It must be an illusion, I thought,
but nevertheless I looked round. There was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>doctor, with his head thrust out of his office-window
on the first floor, calling to me and
beckoning me back.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Did you take away that letter of Mr. Washington’s?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>I searched my pockets, but had it not. Meanwhile
the doctor apparently rummaged on his
bureau, and found it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Here it is! All right!” he cried; and I
passed on.</p>

<p class='c001'>A formal type-written note of introduction,
signed by the great man’s hand, was a thing to
be treasured like a pearl of great price. The first
thought in the doctor’s mind on parting from me
had been to assure himself of its safety!</p>
<hr class='c014' />
<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. For the benefit of English readers, it may be well to state clearly
what Reconstruction meant. I do so in the words of Mr. Edgar
Gardner Murphy (“The Present South,” p. 9): “The policies of
reconstruction represented two cardinal movements of purpose. One
was the withdrawal of political and civic power from those, especially
those in official positions, who had borne arms against the United
States. This effort was an expedient of distrust. It was as natural as
it was unintelligent, and it was as successful as it was mischievous....
This was not all. The suffrage which the masters were denied was by
the same act committed into the hands of their former slaves, vast
dumb multitudes, more helpless with power than without power.” It
is almost universally admitted that the Reconstruction policy was a
mistake, which would never have been made had Lincoln lived, and
that its results were grotesque and often tragic. I find only Professor
Du Bois putting in a word for it and for some of its results. “The
granting of the ballot to the black man,” he says (“The Souls of Black
Folk,” p. 38), “was a necessity, the very least a guilty nation could
grant a wronged race, and the only method of compelling the South to
accept the results of the war.” But he adds, “Thus negro suffrage
ended a civil war by beginning a race feud.” The Reconstruction
policy was overthrown by the “Revolution” of 1876, when the
military support, on which the Reconstruction governments had rested,
was withdrawn.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. That excellent investigator, Mr. Stannard Baker, in his chapter
on “The Tragedy of the Mulatto,” presents a good deal of conflicting
evidence on this point. In the city of Montgomery, with its 35,000
inhabitants, it has been publicly stated without contradiction that 400
negro women live in more or less permanent concubinage with white
men, while “there are thirty-two negro dives operated for white
patronage”; nor does it seem that this state of things is at all exceptional.
On the other hand, the feeling against such connections is
certainly growing, and finds expression on every hand. The New
Orleans <cite>Times Democrat</cite>, for instance, declares it to be a public scandal
that no law against miscegenation should be on the statute-book of
Louisiana, “and that it should be left to mobs to break up the miscegenatious
couples.” Mr. Baker is, however, able to say that “the
class of white men who consort with negro women is of a much lower
sort than it was five or ten years ago.”</p>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>VIII <br /> IN THE BLACK BELT</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>For a whole long hot summer’s day I journeyed
down the Mississippi Valley from Memphis to Vicksburg,
stopping at every wayside station. Here I first
felt—what was afterwards to grow upon me every
day—an impression of the extraordinary potential
wealth of the South. These fat champains, many
of them scarcely reclaimed from the wilderness,
and few of them subjected to more than a rough
surface culture, seemed to me to reek of fertility
and to cry aloud for development. As scenery
they were monotonous enough, but as the seed-plot
of an illimitable future they were vastly
impressive.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was no dining-car on the train, and at
Clarksville, at 12.30, we were allowed twenty
minutes for “dinner.” We rushed for the dingy
refreshment-room, and found at each place a plate
of soup, surrounded by little saucers containing a
cube of butter, a sort of dough-nut in syrup, and
some lettuce with a slice of hard-boiled egg.
There was also at each place a coffee-cup, a
small milk-pot, and some sugar. The soup-plates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>were removed by being piled in the middle of the
table; a negro waiter came round with fresh
plates, and then served the following menu,
all dumped successively upon a single plate:
(1) chunks of boiled bacon with sauerkraut;
(2) stewed veal; (3) mashed potatoes; (4) baked
beans; (5) roast chicken; (6) boiled beef. The
meal ended with pumpkin pie and ice-cream; and
for beverage you had your choice of either coffee
or iced-tea. For this refection the charge was
seventy-five cents, or three shillings—the regular
tariff, it would seem, at roadside stations. Moral:
Never, if you can help it, take a train without a
dining-car.</p>

<p class='c001'>Approaching Vicksburg, we ran for miles and
leagues through a lovely region of luxuriantly
green, vine-tangled forest, mirrored in perfectly
clear water. Here, indeed, might the poet have
sung of</p>

<p class='c017'>How the water got there I cannot say. If it was
simply the result of a flood, how came it so
exquisitely clear? It seemed as though the forest
grew naturally out of this pellucid mirror; the
rather as we passed many open glades of blue
water, where a race of lake-dwellers had built
their cabins on piles. These glades I conceive
to be “bayous,” but found no native who could
inform me. In any case, I shall never forget that
run up to Vicksburg. Until then, I scarcely knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the meaning of the word “green.” The South
was afterwards to teach me many other shades of
its significance.</p>

<p class='c001'>This whole day’s journey lay through the
“black belt” of the State of Mississippi. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Africa in the Ascendant.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It
was manifest to the naked eye that
the black population enormously outnumbered
the white. Few and far
between were the cottages occupied by white
folks, numberless the cabins of the blacks. At
the stations the blacks—who love hanging around
railway stations—were to the whites as ten to
one. They were a lively, good-humoured, talkative
crowd, and on the whole, one would have
said, a fine race physically. Neither the men
nor the women showed any obvious sign of that
dwindling vitality wherein my friend the Memphis
bookseller rejoiced—which is not to say that he
was entirely mistaken as regards the urban negro.
These were rural negroes—a wholly different
matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The newsman on the train was selling the
Memphis <cite>Commercial Appeal</cite>, and I noticed that
he found quite as many customers among the
blacks as among the whites—two or three at each
station. This would have gratified Mr. Booker
Washington, for it was not only a proof of
education but of easy circumstances—the paper
costing just about as much as the <cite>Times</cite>. Mr.
Washington, too, would have rejoiced to see the
rather exquisitely-dressed negro cavalier, mounted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>on a pretty little well-bred mare, with spick-and-span
new saddle and appurtenances, who, at Mound
Bayou, rode up to the Jim Crow car, and chatted
with a friend. Here was the Gospel of the Toothbrush
supplemented by that of the curry-comb.</p>

<p class='c001'>At this point I must face an avowal which I
have long seen looming ahead. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Jim Crow Car.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Without sincerity
these impressions would be worse
than useless. What I <em>think</em> about
the colour question must be superficial,
and may be foolish; but there is a certain
evidential value in what I <em>feel</em>. The whole
question, ultimately, is one of feeling; and the
instinctive sensations of an observer, with the
prejudices of his race, no doubt, but with no local
Southern prejudices, are, so far as they go, worth
taking into account.</p>

<p class='c001'>Well, that day in the “black belt” of Mississippi
brought home to me the necessity of the
Jim Crow car. The name—the contemptuous,
insulting name—is an outrage. The thing, on
the other hand, I regard as inevitable. There
are some negroes (so called) with whom I should
esteem it a privilege to travel, and many others
whose companionship would be in no way unwelcome
to me; but, frankly, I do not want to
spend a whole summer day in the Mississippi
Valley cheek by jowl with a miscellaneous
multitude of the negro race.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Jim Crow car is defended by many
Southerners as a means of keeping the peace,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>and on the ground of the special aversion which,
owing to deplorable and (in time) corrigible
circumstances, the negro male excites in the
white woman. But I think the matter goes
deeper than this. The tension between the races
might be indefinitely relaxed, outrages might
become a well-nigh incredible legend, the Gospel
of the Toothbrush might be disseminated among
the negroes ten times more widely than it is; and
still it would not be desirable that the two races
should be intermingled at close quarters in the
enforced intimacy of a long railway journey. The
permanent difficulty, underlying all impermanent
ones, that time, education, Christian charity, and
soap and water may remove, is that of sheer
<em>unlikeness</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oh! they are terribly unlike, these two races!
I am postulating no superiority or inferiority. I
say, with Bishop Bratton, that “the negro is
capable of development up to a point which
neither he nor any one else can as yet fix;”
and I will even assume that, from an astral point
of view, the negro norm of physical beauty may
be quite as well justified as that of the white.
But they are essentially, irreconcilably different;
and instincts rooted through untold centuries
lead the white man to associate ugliness and a
certain tinge of animalism with the negro physiognomy
and physique. Call it illusion, prejudice,
what you will, this is an unalterable fact
of white psychology; or, if alterable, not in one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>generation, nor yet in one century. No doubt
there is something good-humoured and not
unsympathetic in the very ugliness (from the
white point of view) of the negro. For that
reason, among others, the two races can get on
well enough, if you give them elbow-room. But
elbow-room is just what the conditions of railway
travelling preclude; wherefore I hold the system
of separate cars a legitimate measure of defence
against constant discomfort. Had it not been
adopted, the South would have been a nation
of saints, not of men. It is in the methods of
its enforcement that they sometimes show themselves
not only human but inhuman.</p>

<p class='c001'>Remember that the question is complicated
by the American’s resolute adherence to the
constitutional fiction of equality. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Fiction of Equality.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
As there are no “classes” in the
great American people, so there
must be no first, second, or third class on the
American railways.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Of course, the theory
remains a fiction on the railroad no less than
in life. Everyone travels first class; but those
who can pay for it may travel in classes higher
than first, called parlour-cars, drawing-room cars,
and so forth. The only real validity of the
fiction, it seems to me, lies in the unfortunate
situation it creates with regard to the negro. If
our three classes (or even two) were provided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>on every train, the mass of the negro population
would, from sheer economic necessity, travel
third. It might or might not be necessary to
provide separate cars on that level; but if it
were, the discrimination would not be greatly
felt by the grade of black folks it would affect.
In the higher-class cars there would be no
reasonable need for discrimination, for the number
of negroes using them would be few in comparison,
and personally unobjectionable. The essential
elbow-room would seldom be lacking; conditions
in the first and second class would be very much
the same as they are at present in the North. It
is the crowding, the swamping, the submerging
of the white race by the black, that the South
cannot reasonably be expected to endure; and
what I realized on that day in Mississippi was
that such swamping would be an inevitable and
everyday incident unless measures were taken
to obviate it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Dual Paradox.</div>

<p class='c001'>Of all historic ironies this is surely the
bitterest—that the Republic founded to demonstrate
eighteenth-century ideals of
human equality should have been
fated to provide their most glaring
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>reductio ad absurdum</i></span>. This is far from an original
observation: but there is another paradox in the
case which is not so generally recognized. It is
that the most religious of modern peoples should
all the time be flying in the face of the plainest
dictates of Christianity. The South is by a long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>way the most simply and sincerely religious
country that I ever was in.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> It is not, like
Ireland, a priest-ridden country; it is not, like
England, a country in which the strength of
religion lies in its social prestige; it is not, like
Scotland, a country steeped in theology. But
it is a country in which religion is a very large
factor in life, and God is very real and personal.
In other countries men are apt to make a private
matter of their religion, in so far as it is not
merely formal; but the Southerner wears his
upon his sleeve. There is a simple sincerity in
his appeal to religious principle which I have
often found really touching. I have often, too,
been reminded of that saying of my Pennsylvanian
friend: “The South may be living in the twentieth
century, but it has skipped the nineteenth.” The
Southerner goes to the Gospels for his rule of
life, and has never heard of Nietzsche; yet
I am wholly unable to discover how the system
of race-discriminations is reconcilable with the
fundamental precepts of Christianity. It is far
easier to find in the Old Testament the justification
of slavery than in the New Testament the
justification of the Jim Crow car, the white and
black school, and the white and black church.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>This is not necessarily a condemnation of the
Southerner’s attitude; I do not think that the
colour problem was foreseen in the New Testament.
Christianity is one thing, sociology another,
and the Southerner’s logical error, perhaps, lies in
not keeping the distinction clear.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> But I am sure
there are many sincere and earnest Christians in
the South who will scarce be at ease in heaven
unless they enter it, like a Southern railway
station, through a gateway marked “For Whites.”</p>

its negro members bodily out of doors. They did it with some
consideration for their feelings ... but they virtually said to all their
black members, ‘You cannot worship God with us.’ There grew up,
therefore, the Coloured Methodist Episcopal Church.... From the
North now came those negro church bodies born of colour discrimination
in Philadelphia and New York in the eighteenth century; and thus a
Christianity absolutely divided along the colour-line arose. There may
be in the South a black man belonging to a white church to-day; but
if so, he must be very old and very feeble. This anomaly—this utter
denial of the very first principle of the ethics of Jesus Christ—is
to-day so deep-seated and unquestionable a principle of Southern
Christianity that its essential heathenism is scarcely thought of.”

told, but make the statement “with all reserve,” that no colour-line is
drawn in Roman Catholic churches in the South.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. The perils of biblical argument may be illustrated by this passage
from “An Appeal to Pharaoh,” a book of which I shall have more to
say later (p. 235): “The same inspired authority who tells us that
‘God made the world ... and hath made of one blood all nations of
men, for to dwell on the face of the earth,’ reminds us in the same
breath that He Himself ‘hath determined the bounds of their habitations.’”
But if, on this principle, the presence of the negro in America
is a breach of divine ordinance, what are we to say of the presence of
the white man in America?</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>IX <br /> EDUCATION AND THE DEMONSTRATION FARM</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Enormous undeveloped or half-developed fertility
is the impression one receives on every hand in
the South; but the lack of development belongs
to a state of things soon to pass away. There
can be little doubt that the South stands on the
threshold of an agricultural Golden Age.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> It is
being brought about mainly by three agencies:
(1) The United States Department of Agriculture;
(2) The General Education Board of New York;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>(3) the boll-weevil, which, entering Texas from
Mexico in 1899, has extended its ravages over the
States of Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and
part of Mississippi, and at one time threatened
the ruin of the whole cotton industry. It may
seem odd that this unwelcome invader should
be reckoned among the factors that are promoting
agricultural development; but, in a very real
sense, he has served as a pioneer to the movement.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Wallace Buttrick, of the General Education
Board, was so kind as to give me an outline
of the course of events.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rockefeller to the Rescue.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Our Board,” he said, “was established and
endowed, and has been at various intervals re-endowed,
by Mr. Rockefeller.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To promote education in the
South?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not in the South alone, nor even primarily;
but we had, of course, to study the special
conditions prevailing in the South. We soon
convinced ourselves that the deficiencies of
Southern education—and they were enormous—were
due to the sheer poverty of the country.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a>
In the Southern towns there are good schools,
and the accommodation is fairly adequate. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>only 15 per cent. of the population of the South
is a city population. The remaining 85 per cent.
is rural and agricultural—not even, for the most
part, gathered in villages of any size—so that the
problem of bringing education to the doors of the
people is an immensely difficult one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I suppose compulsory education is not to be
thought of?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is thought of; it is mooted; it is coming;
but not yet awhile. That is just what, as I say,
we realized—that the South is too poor to pay for
an adequate system of education, and that the
problem is too huge a one for even the most
lavish outside philanthropy to tackle. What
was to be done, then? Manifestly to enrich
the Southern agriculturalist, so as to enable him
to pay for the schooling of his children. As it is,
his average income is something like a third of
the average income of a man of his class in
(say) the State of Iowa, where the public-school
system is adequate and satisfactory. Multiply his
income by three, or even by two, and he also
will be able to afford an adequate public-school
system.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So your problem was nothing less than to
double or treble the wealth of the fifteen or
sixteen Southern States?”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Boll-Weevil.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Something like that; and it
was right here that the boll-weevil
came in. With ruin staring them in the face, the
farmers of the affected districts took up eagerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>the system of what are called Demonstration
Farms, organized by Dr. S. A. Knapp, of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. That department,
at its experimental stations and with the
aid of its entomologists, had devised a method of
combating the pest. Roughly speaking, it consisted
of getting in ahead of the weevil—carefully
preparing the ground and selecting the right
varieties of seed, so that the main part of the
crop could be harvested before the insect was
ready to attack it. But it is one thing to devise
a scientific method and another thing to persuade
and teach farmers to carry it out. This difficulty
Dr. Knapp got over by the following means: he
organized a body of skilled agents, who went to
the leading citizens—merchants, bankers, or what
not—of a given district, and said, ‘Introduce us
to the most intelligent and progressive farmer of
your neighbourhood.’ Then to this farmer the
agent would say, ‘If you will set apart a certain
amount of land to be treated, under my supervision,
exactly as I shall prescribe, I (that is to
say, the Government) will provide you with the
right seed for the purpose, and you will see what
the result will be.’ Then meetings would be
called of the neighbouring farmers, principles
explained, and their attention directed to the
experiment. Their life-and-death interest in the
matter would make them watch the result closely;
and as, in each case, the result would be a far
larger crop per acre than they had been used to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>before the appearance of the weevil, you may
imagine whether the methods of culture were
eagerly adopted and the right sorts of seed eagerly
applied for.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An Educational Campaign.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Well, we of the General Education Board
saw in the method of Dr. Knapp’s campaign
against the boll-weevil the very
thing we were wanting. The Government
was operating only in the
boll-weevil districts—there were constitutional
objections to its extending its activity to regions
unaffected by the pest. There we stepped in, and
offered to finance the extension of the Demonstration
Farms to other districts, in accordance with
their needs and capabilities. So long as only a
nominal money appropriation was required of it,
the Government had no objection to our acting
under its authority, our agents thus having the
prestige of Government emissaries. For the
current year, we have appropriated £15,000 to
the work, while Congress has voted a somewhat
larger sum for work in the boll-weevil States.
Altogether, about 12,000 Demonstration Farms
have already been established, and about 20,000
farmers have agreed to ‘co-operate’—that is, to
work the whole or part of their land according
to our instructions. The system is quite new.
It has nowhere been at work more than two years,
and there are many regions which are not yet
even touched by it; but already the results are
surprising.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“It does not, I presume, apply solely to cotton-growing?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly not; on the contrary, one of our
great objects is to break down the exclusive
reliance on cotton so common in many districts,
and to show how the exhaustion of land may be
avoided by the judicious rotation of crops. In
short, we aim at providing object-lessons in
scientific agriculture all over the Southern States,
and of course always with strict reference to the
particular advantages and disadvantages of a
district. I assure you the South is at the opening
of a new agricultural era; and it will not be many
years before our work will produce a marked effect
on education. Come back ten years hence, and
you will no longer find it true that the Southern
school is open, on an average, only about three
months in the year; that the Southerner gets,
on an average, something less than three years’
schooling in his whole life; and that about 10
per cent. of the native-born white population of
the Southern States is wholly illiterate, and
about 40 per cent. of the negro population. We
are going to change all that.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Way to Wealth.</div>

<p class='c001'>Shortly afterwards I met, not Dr. Knapp
himself, but his son, Mr. Arthur Knapp, who
gave me some further information
as to the new era in Southern
agriculture.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not only,” he said, “is much Southern land
unimproved, but much of it is exhausted by careless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>and ignorant cultivation. It has been the method
of many Southern farmers to work their land until
it would no longer raise a paying crop of cotton;
then to sell their farms for what they could get
and move on to fresher soil. The system of
Demonstration Farms will put an end to this,
along with many other abuses and stupidities. It
is the only sound method of educating the farmer.
You may deluge him with Government bulletins
of printed advice without producing the slightest
effect. Even if he reads and understands the
advice, he can’t or won’t apply it in practice.
You must show him the process and show him
the results. Much more is done by talking than
by reading in the South; things circulate from
mouth to mouth much more effectually than even
through the newspapers. Each of the 12,000
Demonstration Farms is visited by from thirty
to one hundred neighbouring farmers. That
means that the object-lessons reach something
like 400,000 every year. And then the spirit of
emulation is awakened. Intelligent and energetic
men are fired with the idea that they will beat
the Government; and they go off and have a very
good try.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think I roughly understand the method of
fighting the boll-weevil; but can you tell me
something of what is being done for the benefit
of other products than cotton?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, we insist on the necessity of better
drainage, of deeper and more thorough ploughing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>of carefully selecting and storing the best varieties
of seed. We demonstrate the judicious rotation of
crops, and show the advantages of devoting
portions of the farm to legumes, which have a
high food value for stock, and at the same time
enrich the soil. Above all, perhaps, we insist on
the necessity of economizing labour by the use
of more horse-power and better implements, and
urge the increasing of stock to such an extent
that all the waste products and idle lands of the
farm may be utilized.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But most, if not all, of these prescriptions
surely demand fresh capital. Where is that to
come from?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, no one pretends that the average
farmer can introduce all these improvements at
once. The fundamental ones do not require more
capital, but only more thought and labour; and,
these once applied, the more expensive improvements
will gradually become possible. The more
intelligent preparation of the soil and selection of
the seed produce wonderful results at once in the
case of corn—what you call maize—no less than
in the case of cotton. If a farmer, under our
guidance, plants half his land with corn and cowpeas,
and only the other half with cotton, he gets
as much cotton as he used to before, and has his
corn and cowpeas in addition, while the land will
be gradually restored to its original fertility. It
is one of our great objects to teach farmers, while
keeping cotton their ‘cash crop,’ as they call it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>to divert from cotton as much land as is necessary
to raise their own essential food-stuffs and the
fodder for their stock—things which, under the
present wasteful system, they mostly buy from
outside.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then the result of all this will not be an
immense and immediate increase in the whole
output of cotton?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not immediate, no; but who can tell what
the ultimate result may be? It is quite possible,
for instance, that a cheaper and more effective
method of combating the boll-weevil may one
day be discovered. As it is, with all our care
in breaking up the hibernating places of the pest,
and planting so that the greater part of the crop
can be secured before he is ready to attack it, we
merely keep him effectively in check, we do not
exterminate him. He still puts us to much
additional labour and expense, and he still gets
the end of the crop.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He seems to have been a valuable stimulus
to effort, however; you ought not to speak
ungratefully of him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“His work in that respect is done—we have
no further use for him. By-the-by, have you
seen his portrait?”</p>

<p class='c001'>And I left Mr. Knapp with my note-book
enriched with a counterfeit presentment, many
times enlarged, of the insect which has co-operated
with Mr. John D. Rockefeller in the
agricultural regeneration of the South.</p>

<hr class='c014' />
<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. “Mr. Richard H. Edmonds, in an illuminating article in the
<cite>Review of Reviews</cite> for February, 1906, has declared that no country
ever dominated, as does the South, an industry of such value and
importance as the cotton crop.... Three-fourths of this great crop,
which must be relied on to clothe civilization, and in the exploitation
of which two billions of capital are used, is raised in the South. It is a
stupendous God-made monopoly. To-day, the South has invested, in
777 mills, with their 9,200,000 spindles, $225,000,000, as against
$21,000,000 twenty-five years ago. The fields of the South furnish
the raw material for three-fourths of the mills of all the world with their
110,000,000 spindles. The South now consumes 2,300,000 bales, which
is about the amount consumed by the rest of the country, and is a
fourfold increase over its consumption in 1890.”—Dr. E. A. Alderman:
“The Growing South,” p. 18. A threefold increase in the cotton-crops
seems easily possible; but whether prices could be kept up
under such conditions is another question. Be this as it may, an
immense agricultural development seems practically certain.</p>

from 1870 to 1880, another $67,000,000 to the loss.”—E. G. Murphy,

I climbed to its highest point, and looked out, at
sunset, over the burnished river and the Louisiana
shore beyond. It seemed one unbroken stretch
of dark forest, which might never have been
threaded by human foot, or only by that of the
Red Man. When the first explorer of the
great river climbed the bluff (as he doubtless
did), he must have surveyed no very different
scene.</p>

<p class='c001'>The town, too, had a touch of the primitive
South about it which I had not hitherto encountered.
Memphis was as civilized and modern
as any Northern city; but Vicksburg, with its
steep-climbing streets, its cavernous, dimly-lighted
shops, and its lounging outdoor life, had something
of the air of an Italian hill-town. The
principal hotel was a gaunt, dingy caravanserai,
with no pretence to modernity about it. Here,
and here only, I may say, I found the Northern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>allegation justified, that the South had lagged
behind the age in things material.</p>

<p class='c001'>An odd little incident brought home to me
vividly the width of the empire of English literature.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Madrigals by the Mississippi.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> At a street corner a sharp-featured Yankee youth, mounted on
a large cart, was carrying on a book-auction,
with a great deal of lively patter. As I
passed, a familiar phrase fell upon my ear:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And shallow rivers, by whose falls</div>
      <div class='line'>Melodious birds sing madrigals.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I stopped and heard him read, not without understanding,
the whole of Marlowe’s canzonet. It
carried me back from the Mississippi to the
Cherwell and the Chess; but what did it mean,
I wonder, to the little crowd of loafers, half white,
half black, that surrounded his stall? Then, with
a little more patter, he modulated into</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“As it fell upon a day</div>
      <div class='line'>In the merry month of May,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and I left him stumbling over the accentuation of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“King Pandion he is dead,</div>
      <div class='line'>All thy friends are lapt in lead.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Passing the same way half an hour later, I heard
him thus deliver himself: “Here y’are—Dr.
Johnson’s great work ‘Rasselas’! Seventy-five
cents for ‘Rasselas’! He was Prince of Abyssinia—that’s
a country in West Africa where they’s
a powerful lot o’ coloured folks.” But there was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>in the phrase of the country, nothing doing in
“Rasselas.” I saw only one actual transaction
concluded—a negro could not resist the allurement
of “Doré’s Bible Gallery,” on which he lavished
three shillings.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next morning I awoke to look out upon a
moist mist rising over the vast green chequer-board
of rice-fields, as we approached
New Orleans. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Disillusionment.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Again a country of
wonderful richness, to which clumps of splendid
trees gave a park-like aspect. The population
seemed sparse. Little wooden churches were
dotted every here and there, each with its pigmy
spire—a feature not elsewhere common. The
whole region, of course, was as flat as a windless
sea.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, oh! the disappointment of New Orleans!
To come from the dainty pages of Cable to this
roaring, clanging, ragged-edged, commonplace
American city! It seemed particularly frayed
and grimy, because the streets had everywhere
been torn up for much-needed sewerage operations;
but under the best of circumstances it must be, I
should say, a city devoid of charm. In respect
of mere width, Canal Street is doubtless a splendid
thoroughfare; but even it, with its two or three
scattered sky-scrapers and its otherwise paltry
buildings, produces a raw, unfinished effect;
while it is so often cluttered up with electric cars,
on its six or eight tracks, as to have the air of
a crowded railway-yard.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>The usually truthful Baedeker tells us that
“New Orleans is in many ways one of the most
picturesque and interesting cities in America,
owing to the survival of the buildings, manners,
and customs of its original French and Spanish
inhabitants.” He further states that “Canal
Street divides the French quarter, or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Vieux
Carré’</span> from the new city, or American quarter.”
I therefore plucked up fresh hope, dodged the
swarming street-cars of Canal Street, and made
for a street of the “Vieux Carré,” which had at
least a French name—Bourbon Street. But here
my disappointment became abysmal. It is difficult
to believe that the French city, with its narrow,
rectangular streets and its commonplace houses,
can ever have been picturesque; now, at all events,
it has sunk into a rookery of grimy and dismal
slums. There is still a certain pleasantness about
the old <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Place d’ Armes</em></span> (now Jackson Square), with
its cathedral and its old-world red-brick Pontalba
Mansions; but, for the rest, the glory of the old
city has absolutely departed. Baedeker duly
informs us where “Sieur George” lived, and
“Tite Poulette,” and “Madame Délicieuse,” but
I did not take the trouble to identify the houses.
If I am ever again to read Mr. Cable with pleasure,
I must forget all I saw of old New Orleans. Of
only one spot in it have I a grateful recollection—namely,
Fabacher’s Restaurant, in Royal Street
(Rue Royale). There I partook of a “Creole
Gumbo”—a soup compounded of ham, crab,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>shrimps, chicken, and oysters—the bouillabaisse,
I take it, of Louisiana.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the new residential quarters of the city, in
St. Charles Avenue and about Audubon Park,
there are, no doubt, many beautiful houses,
pleasantly embowered in semi-tropical vegetation.
One or two of the newest and showiest mansions,
in the Spanish style of architecture, I suspected
of being built after a fashion I had observed on
the outskirts of Memphis—with only a “veneer”
of stone. The essential structure is of wood; but
an outside casing is added, consisting of rusticated
blocks of stone some three or four inches thick,
an air-chamber being left between the stone and
the wood. Whether this method of building is
found successful I cannot say. The effect is often
pleasing enough, even though the Lamp of Truth
may not shine conspicuous in the architecture.</p>

<p class='c001'>A run in a river-steamer for several miles up
and down the Mississippi enabled me to realize in a
measure the commercial magnitude and importance
of New Orleans. But what impressed me most of
all in the city was its cemeteries, of which it is
justly proud. They are certainly magnificent and
“pretentious” cities of the dead. (The word
“pretentious” is currently used in America as
a term of laudation.) Yes; if you want to get
buried with everything handsome about you, by
all means go to New Orleans. But as a place to
live in, I cannot, on short acquaintance, commend
it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Champion of the Children.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>My pleasantest memory of New Orleans is
of a house on Prytania Street—cool and airy, on
an evening of extreme sultriness—where
a lady of Scottish name and
descent was good enough to talk
to me of her manifold public activities. She is
an ardent Suffragist—a rarity in these climes—but,
above all things, she devotes herself to the
work of holding in check, so far as may be, the
terrible evils of child-labour, which its rapidly
growing industrialism has brought upon the
South.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is quite true,” said Miss Graham, in
answer to a question of mine, “that you may
often see the black child going to school while
the white child goes into the factory. The negro
child is not wanted in the factories; it could not
be relied on; it would fall asleep over its work.
You know, I dare say, that we are now overrun
in New Orleans with Southern and Eastern
Europeans—Italians, Roumanians, Lithuanians,
Greeks. It is their children that are the chief
sufferers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In what forms of employment?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, in cotton mills, stocking mills, candy
factories, department stores. We got an Act
some time ago forbidding the employment in
factories of boys under twelve and girls under
fourteen. But the proof of age required was
simply a certificate from the parents! And
the result was to make it appear that most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>boys had been born at the age of twelve, and
most girls at fourteen. We are now agitating
for an Act greatly increasing the penalties for
employing children under age and for issuing
false certificates.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Just before coming here,” I said, “I went
into a boot-blacking ‘parlour.’ It was a long,
close gallery; and there I had seen a dozen little
boys working all this sweltering Sunday under a
‘boss.’ Unless he had relays of boys (which
seems unlikely) they must have been at it, to
my certain knowledge, for eight hours, and I
don’t suppose they will shut down for another
two hours at least.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you had inquired,” said Miss Graham,
“you would probably have found that they were
all Greeks. The negro boot-blacks of New
Orleans used to be quite a class by themselves—Eugene
Field has written a poem about them.
But now they have been quite ousted by the
Greeks; while the negroes, in turn, have ousted
the Italian organ-grinders. Yes, the boot-black
boys are a bad case; but still worse is the case
of the telegraph-messengers. Just think of their
working young boys from six in the evening to
six in the morning—sending them at all hours
of the night into the lowest streets of the lowest
quarters of this wicked city—and paying them
two cents a message.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“At what age do they take them?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, at any age when they can trot and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>have intelligence enough to find an address that
is given them. And, mark you, it isn’t always—perhaps
not generally—extreme poverty that
makes the parents thus sacrifice their children.
Often the children’s earnings will go to pay the
two or two-and-a-half dollars a month demanded
for a piano on the instalment system. That
instalment system is a great curse to the ignorant
poor. I have known a little child sent out to
labour that its mother might acquire—of course
at four or five times its value—what do you think?—a
huge green plush album!</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An Island Inferno.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Just in these days,” Miss Graham continued,
“we have had some terrible revelations of child-labour,
at a certain place on the
Gulf Coast, where more than 200
children, from nine years old upwards,
are kept ‘shucking’ oysters for twelve
hours a day, under the most horrible conditions,
physical and moral. And the Law Committee
of our S.P.C.C. reports that there is no remedy,
because the factory law at present in force in
Louisiana applies only to ‘cities or towns having
a population of 10,000 or more;’ whereas this
place is a little private inferno, owned by a single
company and occupied solely by its serfs. But
we are fighting a good fight for better laws and
better conditions.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My greatly condensed report of her conversation
may lead the reader to mistake Miss Graham
for a one-idea’d humanitarian. There could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>be a greater error. She is an eminently practical,
energetic, broad-minded young lady, with a keen
sense of humour and an interest in many things
outside the work to which she has devoted herself.
I am sure the little children of New Orleans have
in her not only a sincere but a very shrewd and
efficient friend.</p>

<p class='c001'>Miss Graham reported the relations between
the white and coloured populations in New
Orleans rather exceptionally good. The reason,
I think, is not far to seek—namely, that the whites
outnumber the blacks by about three to one.
The acuteness of the problem in any given
locality is apt to depend largely on the numerical
proportions of the races.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On the New Orleans street-cars the two races
are kept apart, but the discrimination is certainly
made with the utmost urbanity. The rear-seats
of each car are marked “For Coloured Patrons
Only.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Montgomery, the legislative capital of Alabama,
has the air of a pleasant and prosperous country
town, with spacious streets, for the most part well
shaded with trees. Its dignified, unpretending
State House—where the Confederate Government
was organized in 1861, and where Jefferson Davis
took the oath as President—is admirably situated
at the top of a gradually sloping hill, and commands
a fine view over the rich, pleasant country.
The soil in this district (and, indeed, in many
parts of Alabama and Georgia) is as red as that of
South Devon, and has naturally imparted its tint
to the swirling Alabama river, which, when I saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>it, reminded me of the rivers through which
Thomas the Rhymer rode in the old ballad:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For a’ the blude that’s shed on earth</div>
      <div class='line'>Rins through the springs o’ that countrie.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I was much disappointed not to find at his
Alabama home Mr. Edgar G. Murphy, whose
book on “The Present South” proves him not
only a humane and judicious thinker, but one of
the most accomplished living writers of America.
I take this opportunity of expressing my great
indebtedness to his admirable work.</p>

<p class='c001'>My most interesting experience in Montgomery
was a long talk with an intelligent and prosperous
negro tradesman, whom I shall call
Mr. Albert Millard. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Contented Negro.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Mr. Millard did
not, on the whole, express serious
dissatisfaction with the condition of his race in
the neighbourhood, and was inclined to take a
hopeful view of the situation in general. “It’s
the low classes of both races,” said he, “that
keep us down and keep friction up.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In labour matters,” he went on, “no galling
colour-line is drawn. In the building trade, for
example, there is a white union and a coloured
union, with a superior council representing both
races. On Labour Day they parade together until
they come to a certain point. Then one body
turns to the right and the other to the left,
and they finish the celebration each in its own
park.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wonder,” I said, “whether that may not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>be a type and model in miniature for the general
solution of the question.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But Mr. Millard’s note changed when I got
him on the administration of justice.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Inter-Racial Justice.</div>

<p class='c001'>“No,” he said, “we do not get
justice in the courts. A negro’s
case gets no fair hearing; and he is
far more severely punished than a white man for
the same offence. I’ll give you a little instance
of the sort of thing that happens. A coloured
man whom I know—a decent, quiet fellow—used
to work in a livery stable. The boss one day fell
a-cursing him so furiously that the man couldn’t
stand it, and said he’d just as soon quit. He went
into a room to take off his overalls; the boss
followed him, and, without more ado, hit him
over the head with an iron crowbar and knocked
him senseless. When the man recovered he got
out a warrant against the boss; but, instead of
listening to his case, the Recorder said he might
be thankful his master hadn’t killed him, and the
next time he appeared in that court he would be
sent to the farm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sent to the farm?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That means fined a sum he couldn’t pay, and
sent to work it out either on the State farm or
under some private employer. Oh, the State makes
a big profit in this way! Suppose a man is fined
20 dollars and costs—say 25 dollars altogether—his
labour being credited to him at 50 cents a
day, it takes him fifty days to work out his fine.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>But his labour is worth far more than 50 cents a
day. Private employers pay the State 60 or 70
cents a day for each convict labourer, and provide
his food as well; but he is credited only with
50 cents all the same.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what are they employed in for the most
part?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, farming in general—cotton, corn, potatoes,
some sugar-cane. The State has lots of
stock. And then there are the truck gardens
(market-gardens) and the coal-mines.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And do you mean to say that all magistrates
behave like the Recorder you spoke of?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When the regular Recorder is away, they
select the hardest of the aldermen to take his
place. There is only one court in which we think
we get justice, and that is the Federal Court.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This is one of the few points on which there is
little conflict of evidence—the negro, in the main,
does not get justice in the courts of
the South.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>An Elective Magistracy.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The tone of the courts
is exemplified in the pious peroration
of the lawyer who exclaimed: “God forbid that
a jury should ever convict a white man for killing
a nigger who knocked his teeth down his throat!”
Exceptions there are, no doubt; there are districts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>in which the negroes themselves report that they
are equitably treated. But the rule is that in
criminal cases a negro’s guilt is lightly assumed,
and he is much more heavily punished than a
white man would be for the same offence;<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a> while
in civil cases justice may be done between black
and black, but seldom between white and black.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would seem, too, that as a rule the negro
lawyer receives scant attention in the courts.
Flagrant instances of this have been related to me—too
flagrant, I hope, to be typical. It is pointed
out, indeed, that while negro doctors are numbered
by the thousand, negro lawyers (despite the argumentative
and rhetorical nature of the race) are
comparatively few. The reason alleged is that,
though colour is no disqualification in the courts
of nature, it practically disbars in the courts of
men.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the last analysis, this condition of affairs
is no doubt a sort of automatic index of the state
of public sentiment in the South. The average
man does not greatly desire, or does not desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>at all, that scrupulous justice should be done to
the negro; and an elective magistracy—elected,
as a rule, for short terms—simply mirrors this
attitude of mind. A Recorder who held the scales
even, as between the races, would quickly become
unpopular with his electorate. He must record
<em>their</em> judgments, or he will record no longer.</p>

<p class='c001'>But there are special causes which tend to
deflect the scale against the negro, and the chief
of these is the system touched upon
by Mr. Millard, which makes convict
labour a source of profit to the State.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Profitable Crime.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> No doubt white men as well as blacks are sentenced
to the “chain-gang”; but it is much more natural
and simple to send a negro than a white man into
judicial slavery.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a> Why let any pedantic rule of
evidence or sentimental scruple of humanity
deprive the commonwealth of a profitable serf?
I find it alleged that in the year 1904 the State
of Georgia made a clear profit of £45,000 out of
“chain-gang” labour leased to private contractors.
There is perhaps some mistake about this, since
the average profit of the previous three years had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>been only £16,000 per annum. But even that
sum is surely £16,000 too much.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>One can understand the attractions of such
a system, however unreal may be the gains that
accrue to the Commonwealth. It is much less
easy to understand another system, expounded to
me by a leading white citizen of the State of
Alabama, which makes it to the interest of magistrates
and other officers of the law to promote
litigation, and to keep the prisons full, because
of the fees it brings them—so much for issuing a
warrant, so much for filing it, so much for making
an arrest, so much for maintenance in prison, etc.
I do not understand this system well enough to
attempt to explain it; but my informant declared
that on one occasion, in his own town, a temporary
magistrate, who was appointed during the serious
illness of the regular occupant of the bench, found
the prison “stacked up” with 500 negroes. Half
of them were “held” on frivolous charges, which
he simply dismissed; on the other half he imposed
light fines which they could pay. “These
iniquities,” my friend continued, “react upon
us; they cost us money, and our gaols are breeders
of crime and filth and disease. But our best
people see it, and they’re going to correct it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>While such systems prevail, it is manifest
that statistics of negro crime must be carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>scrutinized and largely discounted before any
value can be attached to them.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>An Outlawed Race.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> At the same
time there is no doubt a considerable
class of criminal negroes. It is
natural, and indeed inevitable, that
there should be. They are largely illiterate; they
are for the most part poor; their white environment
does all it can to lower rather than to stimulate
their self-respect; the temptations of drink and
drugs (mainly cocaine) beset them in many places;
and when once a negro comes in conflict with the
law, everything is done, not to reclaim him, but
to harden him in crime. When we consider in
how many respects the race is outlawed, it seems
wonderful that more of them should not fall into
habits of outlawry. No one can reasonably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>pretend, I think, that there is in the negro any
innate and peculiar bent towards crime. Give
him an equal chance, and he will show himself
quite as ready as the white man to respect the
criminal law at all events, if not, perhaps, the
precepts of current morality. I cannot believe
that any deep-rooted “original sin” in the African
race is a serious element in the colour problem.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, by treating him with consistent
and systematic injustice, the South is weakening
and confusing her own case against the negro.
In spite of many better impulses among the more
enlightened of her people, her dominant instinct
is to substitute for slavery a condition of serfdom.
The black race is to have no indefeasible rights,
but rather revocable licences to pretend to be
freemen, so long as the pretence does not seriously
interfere with the convenience or profit of the
white race. And specially must the strictest
limits be placed to the freeman’s right to work
when and where he will, and even, if it suits him,
to refrain from working. The South needs the
negro’s labour, and is determined to have it, not
on his terms, but on hers. Far more important
and wide-reaching than the crime-slavery of the
“chain-gang” is the system of debt-slavery or
peonage, whereby a negro, becoming hopelessly
indebted to a white landlord (and store-keeper), is
compelled to spend the remainder of his life in
working off a claim which can never be wiped out,
because, for his very subsistence, he is forced to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>be ever renewing it. There is all the less chance
of escape as accounts are kept by the landlord or
his agent, and the negro is seldom in a position
to check them. Until the law comes to the relief
of the “peon,” and ceases to traffic in the sweat
of the convict, the South, it seems to me, cannot
look the negro squarely in the face.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many Southerners, even the not unthoughtful
or inhuman, make it the first and last word of their
philosophy that “the nigger must be taught to
know his place.” This means, on analysis, simply
that he must accept his position as a serf. But
no more than slavery, I take it, is serfdom permanently
possible in a modern democratic State;

<p class='c001'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. “Two systems of controlling human labour which still flourish in
the South are the direct children of slavery. These are the crop-lien
system and the convict-lease system. The crop-lien system is an
arrangement of chattel mortgages, so fixed that the housing, labour,
kind of agriculture and, to some extent, the personal liberty of the free
black labourer is put into the hands of the landowner and merchant.
It is absentee landlordism and the ‘company-store’ systems united.
The convict-lease system is the slavery in private hands of persons convicted
of crimes and misdemeanors in the courts.”—<cite>Atlanta University
Publications</cite>, No. IX. p. 2.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. On the other hand, Mr. A. H. Stone (“The American Race
Problem,” p. 73) cites several cases of even-handed justice as between
the two races, and adds: “There is not a community in the South
where such things as these do not constantly occur, but their record is
buried in the musty documents of courts, instead of being trumpeted
abroad.” Mr. Stone also quotes a remark by Mr. Booker Washington
to the same effect.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. It appears, however, that in many cases the great demand for
negro labour operates in favour of the negro who has been guilty of
serious crime—he escapes with a fine which is paid by his white
employer, and has to be worked off. Here, for instance, is a report
from the township of Prendergrass, Georgia: “The Negroes in general
are in a bad shape here. There are about eighty criminals here out on
bond, some for murder, some for selling whisky, some for gambling,
some for carrying concealed weapons, some for shooting, and most of
them are guilty, too; but their captain (<i>i.e.</i> employer) takes their part
in court. They generally pay about $25 and work the Negro from one
and a half to two years, and the Negro never knows what it cost.”—<cite>Atlanta

<p class='c001'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. “Besides the penitentiary convicts there were in Georgia in
1902, 2221 misdemeanour convicts undergoing punishment in county
chain-gangs, of whom 103 were white males, 5 white females, 2010
coloured males, and 103 coloured females.”—<cite>Atlanta University Publications</cite>,
No. IX. p. 35.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have seen twelve-year-old boys working in chains on the public
streets of Atlanta, directly in front of the schools, in company with old
and hardened criminals; and this indiscriminate mingling of men,
women and children makes the chain-gangs perfect schools of crime
and debauchery.”—W. E. B. Du Bois: “The Souls of Black Folk,”
p. 180.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. Since writing this I have seen an apparently authentic statement
that in 1907 the profits from the Georgia chain-gangs had gone up to
$354,853, or nearly £71,000.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f32'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r32'>32</a>. “According to the census of 1890,” says Mr. Kelly Miller
(“Race Adjustment,” p. 97), “the negro constituted only 12 per cent. of
the population, and contributed 30 per cent. of the criminals.” But he
goes on to say, “No person of knowledge or candour will deny that the
negro in the South is more readily apprehended and convicted on any
charge than the white offender. The negro constitutes the lower
stratum of society, where the bulk of actionable crime is committed all
the world over.” On the other hand, Mr. E. G. Murphy (“The
Present South,” p. 176) says: “Petty crimes are often forgiven him,
and in countless instances the small offences for which white men are
quickly apprehended are, in the negro, habitually ignored.” A negro
study of negro crime (<cite>Atlanta University Publications</cite>, No. IX.) says,
“It seems fair to conclude that the negroes of the United States,
forming about one-eighth of the population, were responsible in 1890
for about one-fifth of the crime.” This purports to be a correction of
the estimate above quoted by Mr. Kelly Miller. Complete statistics of
a later date do not seem to be available; but according to the same
publication, negro crime reached its maximum about 1895, when negro
convicts numbered 2·33 per thousand of the whole negro population.
Since then the percentage has notably decreased. In 1904 it stood at
1·78 per thousand.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>XII <br /> AN INDUSTRIAL UNIVERSITY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It is very difficult to get at the true truth as to
public education for the negro in the South. The
probability is, in fact, that there are as many
truths as there are points of view. One high
authority (a negro) told me that for every single
dollar expended on a black child about five dollars
are expended on a white child. That is very
likely true; but it is probably no less true that
the sums expended on negro education are large
out of all proportion to the sums paid by negroes
in taxes. “Let us reduce their education to the
scale of their taxation,” I have heard it said, “and
where would they be?”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> The true question is:
Where would the South be? Probably half-way
back to barbarism.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if we ask: Has the South neglected its
plain duty towards the children of the freedmen?
or has it heroically, in its poverty, devoted to the
education of the black child money that could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>ill spared from the beggarly education fund of the
white child?<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a> we cannot rest content with the
answer, “It depends on the point of view.” On
the whole, I am inclined to believe that the
favourable judgment is the true one; but I
should hold it with greater confidence if there
had not existed in the past, and did not survive
to some degree in the present, a violent feeling
against the very idea of negro education. In
many places white teachers of black children are
to this day ostracised.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> One may even say, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>think, that, as a general rule, it takes some
strength of mind for a white man or woman to
follow the vocation of teaching negroes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The hostility to negro education has, however,
lost much of its former strength. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Teacher of Negroes.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This is apparent
from the case of Professor Patterson,
head of an excellent State school
for negroes in Montgomery. The
Professor (a title as lightly accorded in the South
as Major or Colonel) is a sturdy Scot. When he
first came to the South in Reconstruction days
chance led him to a county in the State of
Alabama where there was, indeed, already a
school, but it was kept by a negro who could
neither read nor write. An educator by instinct,
if not by training, Mr. Patterson determined to set
up a school of his own. For this misdemeanour
he was twice shot at, and was finally arrested,
and put under a bond of 15,000 dollars to desist
from teaching in that county. He went into
another county, and started a school in the frame
building that served as a negro church; but here
the negroes themselves had to turn him out, as
they were warned that if they did not the church
would be burnt. These experiences only stiffened
the professor’s backbone. He said: “I <em>will</em> teach—teach
in Alabama—and teach negroes!” And
here he is to-day, head of a fine large school in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>the State capital, and partially maintained by the
State—a school well planned, well built, and with
an excellent system of industrial training going on
in various annexes in its spacious grounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>As I passed through one of the senior school-rooms,
a boy had just written on the blackboard,
in a fine round hand, a quotation from a recent
speech by Senator Foraker on the Brownsville
affair—the affair of the negro regiment which
President Roosevelt is alleged to have treated
with high-handed injustice. The sentence ran:
“We ask no favour for them because they are
negroes, but justice for them because they are
men.” Evidently there is no affectation of excluding
from the schoolroom the all-absorbing
problem.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mr. Washington’s Staff.</div>

<p class='c001'>Tuskegee (pronounced like Righi, but with the
first “e” sound lengthened) is about forty miles
from Montgomery, situated on an
open rolling upland, with many
small knolls and sudden gullies. In
the course of a short drive from the station to the
Institute, one passes a dignified old ante-bellum
plantation-house, not without wondering what its
owners of fifty years ago would have thought of
the Tuskegee of to-day.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am not going to attempt a minute description
of “Booker Washington’s City,” as it has been
called. It is, beyond all doubt, a wonderful place.
Everywhere one sees the evidence of a great
organizing capacity, a great inspiring force, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>tireless, indomitable singleness of purpose—in
short, a true magnanimity. I did not see Mr.
Washington in his principality—I had met him
some weeks earlier in the North—but the dominance
of his spirit could perhaps be more clearly
felt in his absence than in his presence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Washington I did see—a lady with the
mien and manner of a somewhat dusky duchess.
The observation may (or, rather, it does) seem an
impertinence; but such impertinences are forced
upon one by the very nature of the inquiry. Not
only Mrs. Washington, but other members of the
General Staff with whom I was brought in contact—for
instance, Mr. Emmett J. Scott (Mr. Washington’s
secretary) and Mr. Warren Logan (the
treasurer of the Institute)—were far more Caucasian
than African in feature, and very light in
colour. Indeed, I saw no one in high position at
Tuskegee who would not, with a very small
lightening of hue, have been taken without
question for a white man. I make the remark,
however, without suggesting any deduction from
it. I believe there is little evidence of any intellectual
superiority of the mulatto (in all his various
degrees) over the pure negro. It is often assumed
as a matter of course; but those who have had
the best opportunities for close comparison are
quite unconvinced of it. One well-known white
educator of the negro told me that for character,
if not for intellect, he gave the pure black the
preference over the mulatto.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Mr. J. Stevenson, who conducted me over the
Institute, showed precisely the bright intelligence,
the frank, unembarrassed courtesy, the quiet
enthusiasm for his <em>alma mater</em>, which I should
have expected in a senior “college boy” showing
me the lions of Princeton or Cornell.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tuskegee Institute is just twenty-seven years
old. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Tuskegee.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It was opened in 1881 with one teacher
(Mr. Washington) and thirty pupils.
It had a grant of £400 a year from
the Alabama Legislature; but it had no land and
no buildings. Operations began in a dilapidated
shanty and an old church, lent by the coloured
people of the village.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has now, or had two years ago, 2000 acres of
land and 83 buildings, large and small. Its property,
exclusive of endowment fund, is valued at
about £170,000, and it has an endowment fund of
a quarter of a million. It now accommodates
about 1500 students, two-thirds of them male.
More than 6000 students have passed through it,
counting only those who have remained long
enough to benefit appreciably by their course.
Of these 6000 Mr. Washington declares that,
after diligent inquiry (and every effort is made to
keep in touch with former students), he cannot
find a dozen who are not usefully employed; nor
has one Tuskegee graduate been convicted of
crime.</p>

<p class='c001'>Instruction is given in thirty-seven industries,
from agriculture and stock-breeding to printing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>and electrical engineering. Mr. Stevenson took
me through the machine-room, the blacksmithing
and carpentering, carriage-building, harness-making,
tailoring, and shoemaking departments,
the departments of agricultural chemistry, and
of mechanical and architectural drawing. Mrs.
Washington herself was good enough to be my
guide through the women’s building (known as
Dorothy Hall), with its departments of plain
sewing, dressmaking and millinery, mattress-making,
broom-making, basket-weaving, laundry-work,
and cookery, and its model dining-rooms
and parlours, furnished, arranged, and decorated
by the students themselves. Everywhere I saw
earnest work in progress, everywhere order, discipline,
and thorough scientific method. All this
had been made possible, no doubt, by white
money; but the whole organization and conduct
of the Institute is the work of black brains
alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>Externally, Tuskegee has none of the orderly
design which one finds in the “campus” of a
Northern University. It is evidently a place
that has “growed.” Buildings are dotted here
and there over the somewhat rugged site, with
small eye to picturesqueness or dignity of general
effect. Except the Carnegie Library, with its
well-proportioned portico, there is no building of
much architectural ambition; but the chapel or
general assembly hall of the Institute struck me
as showing real originality of design. I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>extremely sorry not to hear one of Mr. Washington’s
Sunday evening “talks” to the students in this
fine hall. I had not time even to see an assembly
of the whole school, in its neat blue uniform, nor
to hear its singing of old negro melodies, which
is said to be remarkable.</p>

<p class='c001'>In speaking of Tuskegee architecture, one
must not omit to mention that nearly all the
buildings of the Institute are built by the students
themselves, of bricks burnt in their own brickyard.
All furniture and fittings, too, are made
and repaired within the Institute. I went through
one or two of the students’ dormitories; the little
cubicles were simple, neat, clean, fairly comfortable,
but entirely devoid of luxury or upholstery.
As I have before explained, tuition is provided
by endowment, while the students are supposed
to pay for their board and lodging at the rate of
about thirty-five shillings a month, which they
are enabled to earn, wholly or in part, for
themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>After a far too brief visit, I left Tuskegee
with the liveliest admiration for its methods and
results. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Reflection and a Query.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is beyond all question
a radiating centre of materially
helpful and morally elevating influences.
Mr. Washington is assuredly doing a
great and an indispensable work for his race;
nor is he doing it in any such spirit of contempt
for academic and literary culture as his critics
attribute to him.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>But two reflections occurred to me as I
returned through the red twilight to Montgomery.
The first was obvious enough—namely, that the
men and women turned out by such an institution
as Tuskegee cannot possibly be taken as representing
the average of negro capacity. They are
a select company before they go there—or, rather,
in the very fact of their going there. They are
impelled by individual and exceptional intelligence,
thirst for knowledge, desire for betterment.
Some, it is true, are sent by their parents, very
much as white boys are sent to school or college;
but whereas the white boy’s parents are merely
following a social tradition, the black boy’s parents
are taking a clear step in advance, and showing
not only ambition but (in all probability) a good
deal of self-denial. Almost every one, in short,
who enrols himself at Tuskegee is animated from
the outset by some measure of Mr. Washington’s
own spirit; and not a few show, in the pursuit
of knowledge, something of the heroism which
marked his early career.</p>

<p class='c001'>My second reflection took the form of a
query. I did not doubt for a moment that Mr.
Washington’s work was wise and salutary; but
I wondered whether the material and moral uplifting
of the negro was going to bring peace—or
a sword. In other words, do the essential
and fundamental difficulties of the situation really
lie in the defects of the negro race? May not
the development of its qualities merely create a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>new form of friction? And far beneath the
qualities and defects of either race, may there
not lie deep-rooted instincts which no “Atlanta
Compromise” will bring into harmony?</p>

<p class='c001'>Tuskegee marks an inevitable stage of the
conflict; but is it the beginning of the end? I
wonder.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f34'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r34'>34</a>. Among the native (as opposed to foreign-born) white population
of the Southern States, there were in 1900 about 11 per cent. of
illiterates of ten years old and upwards, as against a percentage of 4·6
for the whole United States. But this 11 per cent. showed a great
improvement during twenty years; for in 1880 there were over 20 per
cent. of illiterates. Among the coloured population of the same States,
the illiterates in 1900 numbered about 48 per cent., as against 75 per
cent. in 1880. It must be remembered that nearly 85 per cent. of the
people of the South live in sparsely populated rural districts, where it
is difficult for the schoolmaster to reach the children or the children
the schoolmaster. In the whole United States, the annual expenditure
per head of the pupils in average attendance at public schools is over
$21, whereas in Alabama and the Carolinas it is only $4·50; yet in
these States 50 per cent. of the whole State revenues for general
purposes is appropriated to public education. See an admirable paper
in “The Present South,” by Edgar Gardner Murphy. At the close of
the war, says Mr. Murphy, “the South—defeated, impoverished,
desolate—was forced to assume the task of providing for the education
of two populations out of the poverty of one.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f35'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r35'>35</a>. This is so in Atlanta, according to Mr. Stannard Baker. I cannot
resist quoting from Mr. Baker’s book a letter written by “a well-to-do
white citizen” to a South Carolina newspaper, apologizing for an act of
courtesy to a negro school—</p>

<p class='c001'>“I had left my place of business here on a business trip a few miles
below; on returning I came by the above-mentioned school (the Prince
Institute, coloured), and was held up by the teacher and begged to
make a few remarks to the children. Very reluctantly I did so, not
thinking that publicity would be given to it, or that I was doing anything
that would offend any one. I wish to say here and now that I am
heartily sorry for what I did, and I hope after this humble confession
and expression of regret that all whom I have offended will forgive me.”</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>XIII <br /> HAMPTON: AN AFTERMATH</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>After the daughter, the mother. Being again
in America this year (1909), I stole a few days
for a run into Virginia and a visit to Hampton,
the fount and origin of the whole movement for
the industrial training of the coloured race. It
is perhaps well to take Tuskegee before Hampton,
just as, in visiting English Universities, it would
be well to take Liverpool or Birmingham before
Oxford or Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hampton is on historic ground, and looks
over still more historic waters. It stands at the
tip of the peninsula formed (roughly speaking)
by Chesapeake Bay to the east and north and the
James River to the west and south. Yet not
quite at the tip; for the spit of land which
Captain John Smith in 1608 named Point Comfort
runs some two miles further to the southward,
and forms a sort of breakwater for Hampton
Roads. The spit of land, now known as Old
Point Comfort, is entirely given over to two great
establishments—Fortress Monroe, where Jefferson
Davis was imprisoned after the war, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Hotel Chamberlin, one of those huge American
caravanserais which are devoted to the cultivation
partly of health, partly of sport, and wholly of
fashion. The Chamberlin, despite its Pompeian
swimming-bath and its circular dancing-pavilion
built out over the waters of the sound, is not
quite so extensive or so sumptuous as the Virginia
Hot Springs Hotel, to say nothing of the Ponce
de Leon and other palaces of Florida; but its
life has a colour of its own, due to the large
infusion of artillery officers from the Fort, which
is but a stone’s throw away. The coming and
going of the great white river-steamers, too, lends
animation to the scene. Old Point is a meeting-place
for these floating hotels, hailing from New
York, Baltimore, Washington, and Richmond.
Moreover, there is plenty of shipping in the
Roads, consisting for the most part of the great
four- and five-masted schooners which still abound
in these waters. Some six miles up the estuary
to the westward rise the immense coal elevators
of Newport News, with its navy-yard; while to
the southward, on the further shore, towards
Norfolk, one can dimly descry a city of towers
and domes, the buildings of the Jamestown
Exhibition of 1907. Altogether, despite the
flatness of the coasts, this confluence of great
estuaries with the Atlantic has a nobility and
beauty of its own. The sky-effects are marvellous.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In Pastures Green.</div>

<p class='c001'>Twenty minutes in the electric car carry you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>from the Chamberlin to Hampton Institute, from
valetudinarianism and luxury, time-killing and
life-killing,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a> to industry, frugality,
character-building and—in far more
than a theologic sense—soul-saving.
The Institute is divided from the little town of
Hampton (with its church built in 1660, of English
bricks) by a wide creek, known as the Hampton
River, which was populous, when we passed it,
with negro oyster-dredgers. On a spacious
campus, bordering on this creek, stand the
buildings of the Institute—looking out upon the
very reach of the Roads where the fight between
the Merrimac and the Monitor opened a new
chapter in naval history. Both banks of the
creek are well-wooded, and the white houses,
with their wide verandahs deep-set in the tender
green of early spring, gave the scene a semi-tropical
air. It needed only a few palm-trees to
transport one to Florida. The campus, too, is
rich in flowering shrubs. A marvellous rose-tree
in full bloom almost covered the office-building;
hard by, a great bush of wisteria (standard, not
climbing) made the air heavy with scent; and
tulip-trees and climbing wisteria were to be seen
at every turn. In the exquisite amenity of its
site lies one great contrast between Hampton
and Tuskegee. The red and gully-gashed Alabama
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>upland, where Booker Washington has established
his city, is unkempt, almost untimbered, and as
nearly bleak as any place can be in that southern
climate; whereas the Hampton student may sing
with literal truth:—</p>

<p class='c017'>But as I watched the negroes plunging their
dredgers into the mud of Hampton Creek, I

Tuskegee might not be the healthier habitation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Pious Founder.</div>

<p class='c001'>The fundamental contrast, however, between
the two institutions lies in the fact that at
Tuskegee the organizing and teaching
staff is all black (or brown), at
Hampton all white.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a> The founder
of Hampton, General S. C. Armstrong, was born
in the Sandwich Islands in 1839, the son of a
missionary. He was a man of extraordinary
strength and vitality, a muscular Christian in
the fullest sense of the term. In the war, he
commanded a negro regiment,<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a> and after the
war he put aside all opportunities of personal
gain and advancement to devote himself to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>work of the Freedmen’s Bureau. This brought
him to Hampton; and here, in April, 1868, he
opened his school, with one assistant teacher
and fifteen pupils. Next year the attendance
increased to sixty-six, and in 1870 the Institute
received a charter (but no endowment) from
the Virginia Legislature. In 1878 it was decided
to admit Indians as well as negroes, and now
about ten per cent. of the students belong to
the aboriginal tribes. Armstrong had immense
difficulties to contend with. The whole of the
money for his enterprise had to be raised by his
personal exertions; and the value of his idea—the
value of negro education in general and
industrial training in particular—was not then
a tested fact, but remained to be proven in the
face of much scepticism. A minor difficulty lay
in the prejudice of the negroes themselves against
manual training. This was still, in their eyes,
the badge of servitude; and they were apt to
rebel when, asking for Greek, they were given
a hoe. With indomitable energy and geniality,
however, Armstrong stuck to his task; and when,
early in the nineties, he was stricken with paralysis,
Hampton was already a great institution, and
Tuskegee was firmly founded.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Hampton there are now 113 buildings (65
of them of considerable size) and a home farm of
120 acres; while at Shellbank, six miles away, the
school owns a farm of over 600 acres, with 150
head of cattle, 30 horses and mules, 100 hogs, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>fowls by the thousand. The students enrolled in
the Institute number 863, while the Whittier
Preparatory School has nearly 500 pupils. In
addition to all branches of agriculture and horticulture,
fifteen trades are taught to boys, while
girls are thoroughly trained in every form of
domestic industry, laundry-work, dressmaking, etc.
The teaching and organizing staff numbers about
200, or one to every six pupils. It is the deliberate
policy of the Institute to seek for increase of
efficiency rather than of numbers, and the entrance
tests are correspondingly severe.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Principal, Dr. H. B. Frissell, was unfortunately
absent when I visited Hampton. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Tour of the Institute.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> I had
met him a year before at Memphis,
and learnt to appreciate his quietly
commanding personality. Mrs. Frissell
received us most courteously in the very
beautiful old plantation-house which is now the
Principal’s residence. A patriarchal hospitality is
the tradition at Hampton, and we were cordially
invited to remain, if not a week, at least a night.
But a few hours were all we could spare; and the
chaplain, Dr. Herbert Turner, very kindly constituted
himself our guide.</p>

<p class='c001'>He took us first to “the soul of the institution,”
the Memorial Church, externally a fine building,
internally, to my mind, memorably beautiful. It
is a cruciform structure of romanesque style; but
the arms of the cross are so short that they may
be called apses rather than nave and transepts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>and the great body of the space is covered by the
dome. The four great arches are magnificent in
their airy dignity, and the material, red and cream
brick, is at once simple and beautiful. The
doctrine here preached is entirely undenominational.
The students are encouraged to adhere
to their own denominations, “as they will thus
be best able to serve the communities to which
they return.” The official designation of the
building is simple—“The Church of Christ in
Hampton Institute”—and after several hours’ talk
with Dr. Turner, I feel sure that his flock will
imbibe from him no harsh or illiberal theology.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We lay the greatest stress first and last,” he
said, “on character-building. It is not the clever
self-seeker that we look for and encourage—not
the youth whose aim is personal success and
money-making. It is the service he is to do to
his people that we keep constantly before the
student’s mind; and with the great majority that
is actually and effectively the dominant idea.
Many of them, of course, are training to be
teachers; but all of them feel that they can
teach indirectly in their different communities, by
uprightness in life and efficiency in work. We
follow carefully the careers of our students, and I
am able to say that 83 per cent. of those who
are now out in the world are Christian men and
women, not merely in the sense of church-membership,
but of the practical Christianity
which is known by its fruits. We are especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>careful to cultivate mutual kindliness and good
feeling among teachers and pupils alike. It was
a saying of General Armstrong’s that ‘cantankerousness
is worse than heterodoxy,’ and we still
take that view.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you many students,” I asked, “who
are supported by comparatively well-to-do
parents?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very few,” Dr. Turner replied; “and we
do not particularly care for that class of young
man or woman. All new students have to bring
with them a registration-fee of ten dollars, and
eleven dollars for one month’s board; but the
great majority of them need little more than
that, for they are immediately put to various
sorts of unskilled work by which they are enabled
to earn from fifteen to twenty dollars a month,
and so can not only pay their current board
bills, but lay up a sum to meet the expenses
of the next year, when they go into the day-school
or into trades in which, during their
apprenticeship, they are unable to earn anything.
You remember how Booker Washington, when he
first presented himself, was so ignorant that he
was almost rejected; but when he was told, by
way of trial, to clean a room, the superintendent
noticed that the dark corners were as thoroughly
cleaned as the most visible parts, and accepted
him on the strength of that observation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>We were now in the boot- and harness-making
division of the Trade School building. Pursuing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the theme of thoroughness suggested by the
anecdote of Booker Washington, Dr. Turner
continued—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Principles and Methods.</div>

<p class='c001'>“We insist that every student
shall become highly skilled in whatever
trade or pursuit he takes up; but we allow
him to acquire a partial and rough-and-ready
knowledge of other crafts subsidiary to his own.
For instance, it is found that the individual
harness-maker cannot compete with factory work,
so that few students now take a complete course
in that craft; but a boy who becomes a thoroughly
skilled shoemaker also learns so much of harness-making
as to render him an efficient repairer.
In the same way our thoroughly trained carpenters
also acquire a certain amount of skill in bricklaying,
plastering, painting, and tinsmithing; and
the girls, in addition to complete instruction in
house-work, laundry-work, dressmaking and cooking,
also learn something of simple carpentry,
paper-hanging, painting, and the repairing of tinware,
shoes, etc. In small villages and country
districts it is very important to know something
of everything as well as everything of something.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And where, amid all this, does academic
study come in?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Students in their first year who are working
for wages attend the night-school only. After
that, if they are training for teachers, they enter
the day-school, and devote only a minor portion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>of their time to manual work. But we take care
that those who are mainly engaged in handicrafts
and agriculture do not neglect their mental development
on the academic side; and we find, with
scarcely an exception, that the boy who does the
best work in the classroom does the best work at
the bench. The annual cost of academic training
(apart from board, etc.), is seventy dollars, or £14,
of industrial training, thirty dollars, or £6. To
many of our students, in accordance with their
abilities and their necessities, we are able to allot
scholarships which cover these fees; but we are
greatly in need of more such scholarships. For
the general needs of the institution an endowment
fund of three million dollars is required; but as
yet we have been able to raise only about half that
sum. The United States Government pays a
small sum for each of the Indians whom it sends
to the Institute; but it does not cover their
expenses.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how do the negroes and the Indians get
on together?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Without the slightest friction. They live in
separate houses—there is the Wigwam, the home
of the Indian boys, and nearer the river is Winona
Lodge, the Indian girls’ dormitory. But you
have seen them working side by side in the workshops,
and you will see them presently dining side
by side in Virginia Hall.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“A Changed Ideal.”</div>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Turner took us through the very interesting
Indian Museum, used also as a lecture-hall, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>through the beautiful and admirably equipped
Huntington Memorial Library, containing, among
other things, one of the largest
existing collections of books on the
negro race and its problems.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you find,” I asked, “that many of your
students come to you with the idea that book-learning
is a more dignified and desirable thing
than manual training?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” was the reply; “that particular form
of ignorance is rapidly passing away. But now
and then students come to us with ambitions
which we can scarcely encourage. A good many
years ago now, a boy presented himself with the
announcement that he wanted to be trained for
the career of a prize-fighter. We did not reject
him, but we found means of modifying his aspirations.
He proved to be an unusually intelligent
youth, and at the end of his course was chosen
the valedictorian of his class. The subject of his
address was ‘A Changed Ideal.’ He is now the
head of an agricultural college.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Happy Family.</div>

<p class='c001'>Our perambulation of the Institute was interrupted
by the bugle call summoning us to midday
dinner in Virginia Hall, a building
partly “sung up” by a travelling
band of Hampton singers. The
beautiful quality of the students’ voices was manifest
in the short grace which they sang. We
went through not only the dining-hall, but the
kitchen, and were much struck by the brilliant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>cleanliness and neatness of all the arrangements,
the rapidity of the service, and the appetizing
appearance of the meal. The young men and
girls sit together at the same tables, a lively,
talkative, but well-mannered company—with
enviable appetites, if one may judge by the rapidity
with which dishes were sent back to the kitchen
to be replenished. I noticed that for the most
part, though not strictly, the Indians and the
negroes kept to separate tables. None of the
white instructors took part in the meal.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hampton was the only negro college or school
I ever visited in which I saw no student who
could have passed as white. There was, indeed,
one singularly beautiful girl with auburn hair, who
might have been taken for a European of peculiarly
rich colouring; but she was of Indian, not
of negro, blood. There must, I think, have been
some reason for the absence of “white negroes”
at Hampton; but I had not time to inquire into
it. We bade an unwilling farewell to our kind
hosts, and departed deeply impressed by the spirit
and achievement of this noble institution.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>XIV</p>

<p class='c001'>BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA</p>

<p class='c001'>Birmingham, Alabama, is a city not yet forty years
old; yet it numbers, with its suburbs, 150,000
inhabitants. It is the Pittsburg of the South,
the centre of a great and rapidly growing iron
and steel industry. But as yet it has not created
anything of a “black country” around it. From
the roof of its splendidly equipped and organized
High School I saw nothing in its environment
but pleasant wooded hills and flourishing “residential”
suburbs. The city itself has spacious
streets, handsome shops, at least two first-class
hotels, a fine Court House, and an excellent streetcar
service. There is far less rawness in Birmingham
than in many American cities three times
its age.</p>

<p class='c001'>A very remarkable feature of the town is the
splendid Union Station now in course of completion.
Among the most conspicuous proofs of
the prosperity of the South are the spacious and
handsome railway stations, which are everywhere
replacing the grimy old shanties of the past. In
almost all, as though by special word of command,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>the Spanish Mission style of architecture is
adopted, with its two towers crowning either end
of the structure. This Union Station at Birmingham
was perhaps the finest I saw; but the new
station at Atlanta runs it hard; and Charleston,
Jacksonville, even little Vicksburg, have all handsome
and commodious stations. Each has its
separate entrance, waiting-rooms, ticket-office,
etc., “for White Passengers” and “for Coloured
Passengers.” In some the colour-line is very
palpably drawn in the shape of a thick brass rod
running across the main hall, or “concourse,”
and dividing it into two (unequal) portions. One
end of this rod runs into the news-stand, the
other into the ticket-office; so that in each of
these departments both races can be served by
one staff of clerks. Wherever I observed this
rod, it was no provisional or movable device,
but fixed as the foundations of the building.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two little traits which I noted in the streets
of Birmingham are perhaps worth reproducing.
The first was a parcel-van with the legend—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>IMPERIAL LAUNDRY</div>
    <div class='c000'>WE WASH FOR WHITE PEOPLE ONLY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Tho second was a placard inspired by a more
catholic spirit. It ran: “Largest glass of beer
in the city, for White or Coloured, 5 cents.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Phillips, Superintendent of the Birmingham
Public Schools, was kind enough to take me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>over the really magnificent High School building
above mentioned, in which, by the way, manual
and industrial training is as largely
provided for as literary training. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Young Idea.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In
Dr. Phillips’s opinion, compulsory
education is now well within sight in Alabama.
They have already, he said, in the Birmingham
district, approximately the school accommodation
required under a system of compulsion. From
a statistical report it appears that the number
of “seats” provided in the nine white schools
of the city is 4903, while in the four negro
schools only 1607 are provided; whereas it would
seem that the negro population is little, if at
all, less numerous than the white. Indeed,
the same report points to the inadequate accommodation
for coloured pupils as an evil calling
for prompt remedy. I note with interest that in
the school year ending June, 1907, the “Cases of
Corporal Punishment” are set down as “White:
57. Negro: 432.” As the average daily attendance
of negroes was less than half that of the
whites, these figures mean a ratio of something
like sixteen to one. On the other hand, when we
come to “Cases of Suspension” we find, “White:
105. Negro: 9.” It is clear that totally different
systems of discipline are applied to the two races.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the question of the relative mental capacity
of white and coloured children Dr. Phillips holds
decided views.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whatever the anthropologists may report,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>he says, “the black race is to all intents and
purposes a young race; therefore it is imitative.
The black child has a good word-memory and a
good eye-memory. He will often learn by rote
quicker than a white child—but it is a different
thing when it comes to understanding what he
learns. Such an imitative function as writing
comes at least as easy to the negro as to the
white; but in anything that requires reasoning—in
mathematics, for instance—the negro soon falls
behind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a general agreement, I may say,
as to the remarkable brightness of the young
negro child, and a scarcely less general agreement
as to the fact that this brightness does not usually
last far into the teens. Some theorists tell you
that the sutures of the skull close earlier in the
black than in the white, and thus do not leave
room for brain expansion. In the West Indies
it is said that precocious sexual development
checks the mental growth of the negro. On the
other hand, negro investigators seek to show
that the difference, in so far as it is not purely
imaginary, arises from such accidental causes as
the inferior nutrition of the average black child.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Phillips differs from some other authorities
in holding the mulatto distinctly superior in
mental capacity to the pure black.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> As to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>industrial training, he admits its value for the
negro, but adds that an undue proportion of
the race, even when brought up to a trade,
manifests an invincible preference for “some
sort of teaching or preaching”—in a word, for
an easier life.</p>

<p class='c001'>It seemed as though all my introductions in
Birmingham, save that to Dr. Phillips, were to
be of no avail. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Character.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> One gentleman had
gone to Kansas, another had gone
to a picnic, a third had gone where not even an
inquisitive journalist could follow him—at least
for the present. I had packed my “gripsack” in
preparation for an early start on the morrow,
when my telephone bell rang, and a visitor was
announced. It was the gentleman who had gone
to Kansas; and to his timely return, and kind
promptitude in calling on me, I owe one of the
most interesting hours of all my pilgrimage. He
stated few facts, and some of these I have already
mentioned in other contexts; he was very chary
of pronouncing judgments; but he gave me a
charming glimpse of Southern (though certainly
not typical Southern) character.</p>

<p class='c001'>A man of middle height, with a clear-cut,
aquiline, rather careworn face, and iron-grey hair.
His features would certainly not strike you at first
sight as beautiful, or even as distinguished; you
might class him, in a crowd, as a well-to-do
farmer; but ten minutes’ talk brought out a
curious distinction and charm in his face. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>reminded me, vaguely, of portraits of Cardinal
Newman. He looked far older than his years—at
least, I found myself treating him with the
deference due to marked seniority, and was
amazed when it appeared that he was three
years my junior. He had taken life earnestly,
strenuously; he had been very successful in his
business career, and he felt his success, not as an
end achieved, but as an obligation imposed; so
much I very soon made out from his slow,
reflective, simple, and open-hearted talk.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’m ve’y much attached, sir,” he said, “to
the negro race. My father was a large slaveholder,
and he had a passion for them. He
selected and bought ve’y fine types of negroes.
Fo’ myself, I have now an entirely negro household,
and they are all of them devoted to my wife
and to my children. Fo’ instance, we have in our
house a coloured woman of fo’ty-five or fifty—an
old maid and a ve’y clever woman indeed—who is
passionately attached to my youngest daughter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was curious to find such an old-time, antebellum
household subsisting in the go-ahead, intensely
modern city of Birmingham. I felt,
however, that this casual survival had very small
bearing upon the problems of the present or
future; so I tried to get at my visitor’s feeling
on some of the burning topics of the actual
situation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Almost in vain. He would not express himself
either for or against the “Jim Crow car,” though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>he was emphatic on the iniquity, which President
Roosevelt also has recently denounced, of giving
negroes inferior accommodation for the same rates
as those charged to the whites. Not even on the
question of “miscegenation” would he give a
decided personal view.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Mills of God.</div>

<p class='c001'>“I feel,” he said, “that these people have
been left on our hands through no fault of their
own, and that it is our duty to do
the best we can for them,  each in
his own way. It is the business of
some people to think out theoretical questions;
but that is not my business. I try to do what
practical good I can from day to day—and that
keeps my hands pretty full. As for such questions
as that of social equality or inequality, they will
settle themselves in time, through the thinkers
and professional men of both races. Solutions
will be found for many problems that now seem
terribly difficult, if both races will only have
patience. You know,</p>

      <div class='line in2'>His wonders to perform.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>—these lines often come back to me.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Many whites in the South,” he went on,
“have hitherto held aloof from the negro cause,
because they felt that the negro regarded them
with suspicion and preferred to look for help to
the North. That feeling is now passing away on
both sides.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>He had, naturally, no sympathy with the idea
of supplanting negro labour with imported European
labour. “Even if there were nothing else
against it,” he said, “it is bad business policy.
The Italians have carried four hundred million
dollars out of the country in [I forget what space
of time], whereas the earnings of the negro remain
in the country. Sixty-five per cent. of the raw
material produced in this district is mined by
negroes.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Judge Not, that Ye be not Judged.</div>

<p class='c001'>I tried in vain even to get at what he regarded
as the chief mistakes made by white people in
dealing with negroes—at the reasons,
for instance, why such households  as
his own were now such rare exceptions.
He could not be got to pass any judgments,
even on his own race. The nearest he came to it
was in this speech, which I reproduce almost word
for word:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My wife is a ve’y beautiful woman. Other
ladies say to her, ‘Oh yes, Mrs. ——, you get on
with yo’ negroes because yo’ beautiful an’ yo’ rich—but
it’s ve’y diffe’ent with us.’ But seems to
me ’tisn’t he’ beauty no’ he’ wealth that makes the
diffe’ence—’tis he’ ha’at.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As to those questions you ask me,” he said,
as we were parting, “I read a’ticles upon them
with great interest—oh yes, su’, with great interest
and profit. But what is happening now is to me
of mo’ impo’tance than what may possibly happen
fifty years hence.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“You are going to Atlanta? Then you will
see Judge Mansfield. He can tell you far more
than I can on all these matters.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I did see Judge Mansfield, and he did tell me
more.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>XV <br /> THE CITY OF A HUNDRED HILLS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The quaintly named “Seaboard Air Line” carries
you from Birmingham to Atlanta, Georgia, for the
most part through a region of fresh and woody
highlands, with blue mountains on the southern
horizon. The woods consist of pine and leaf trees
about evenly mixed. Large tracts of them, unfortunately,
have been ruthlessly hewn or burnt
away—that crime against the future so prevalent
in America.</p>

<p class='c001'>Atlanta is finely situated at an elevation of
about 1000 feet above the sea, on a billowy upland
which has earned for it the name of “the city of
a hundred hills.” The guide-book states that it
is “laid out in the form of a circle”; but to the
casual observer it seems to lack the usual regularity
of plan. It has many spacious streets and handsome
buildings, with the usual sprinkling of
sky-scrapers. Its Park Lane or Fifth Avenue is
named Peachtree Street, and is a really beautiful
winding road, with handsome houses on either
hand, shadowed by fine trees. It was hard to
believe that this well-built, bright, busy, windy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>city had, only eighteen months before, been the
scene of a sanguinary riot, almost a massacre,
in which many innocent coloured people lost their
lives.</p>

<p class='c001'>The population of Atlanta is a little over
100,000, about 40 per cent. being coloured. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Gunpowder and Fire.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Most
of the white people, I was told, come
of a mountain stock, who never held
slaves or came in contact with the
negro before the war. Hence there is even less
of mutual comprehension between the races here
than elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c001'>The riot was the outcome of a political campaign,
in which negrophobia had been carefully
worked up with a view to securing votes—yellow
journalism aiding with inflammatory
headlines. Then came a series of five or six
outrages on women within twenty-four hours.
Two of them, perhaps, were genuine; the rest
were figments of hysterical imagination. The
papers came out with edition after edition, piling
horror on horror’s head; the saloons seethed
with virtuous and highly alcoholized indignation;
and some trifling incident sufficed to let loose
the bloodthirsty frenzy of the mob. The police
judiciously made themselves scarce, and for four
days there was no law in Atlanta.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is admitted on all hands that not one of
those who were killed was even suspected of any
crime. The mob went from unprotected house
to house, ostensibly searching for firearms. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>it kept carefully to parts of the city where it knew
it would meet with no real resistance. It did
not go down into the negro quarter; it avoided
the criminal negro, whose criminality might have
gone the length of “putting up a fight.” It
preferred to harry the respectable and law-abiding
coloured person, and “teach him his place.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Atlanta is now very sorry for its sport. Its
better people, of course, reprobated and deplored
the riot from the first; but even the average
man soon realized what it had cost the city.
Its credit was shaken; there was an immediate
fall in real estate and rise in wages. In no
community does the sane element favour such
outbreaks; but I had only to think of my Memphis
bookseller to realize that nowhere in the South
is the point very far distant at which the insane
element may get out of hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>There were fears of an outbreak last Christmas,
and if it had come it would have been a very
different matter, for the negroes were armed to the
teeth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor did my talk with Judge Mansfield (as I
shall call him) altogether reassure me. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Friend of the Negro.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The
Judge is one of the leading citizens
of the State, and took a prominent
part in a sort of conciliation
movement which immediately followed the riot.
He is a man well advanced in years, was himself
a slaveholder before the war, and is full of the
warm Southern sentiment for the “old-time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>negro.” He is well known among white people
as a friend of the coloured race and a defender
of its rights. I do not know whether the negroes
themselves rank him high among their champions.</p>

<p class='c001'>He seemed to me more concerned with injustices
done by the North to the South than
with injustices done by the South to the negro.
“Sherman said, ‘War is hell,’” so he led off;
“but there is a worse state than hell, and
we passed through that state. It was called
Reconstruction.”<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As to that, however, he was content to let
bygones be bygones. His real complaint was of
the immediate past and present—of the ignorant
intermeddling of Northern folk in Southern affairs,
the ignorant and contemptuous criticisms of the
Northern Press.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The other day,” he said, “Mr. Smith, a Congregationalist
minister—I’m a Baptist myself, but
I have a great respect for the Congregationalists—Mr.
Smith came to me and said, ‘I hear that the
coloured people in your town are sending their
children to school in flies and waggons rather than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>let them ride in the street-cars. What am I to
say to my people in the North about that?’ ‘I
suggest, sir,’ was my reply, ‘that you should tell
them it is none of their business.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>He was absolutely opposed in theory to lynching,
but seemed hopeless of its being put down so
long as outrages on women continued. Here,
again, his last word was a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tu quoque</em></span> to the North:
“I addressed a meeting in Ohio last year, and I
said to them, ‘Here in Ohio you have 2 per cent.
of negroes; in Georgia we have 47 per cent.; yet
you have lynchings here, not so many fewer than
ours. Until we have twenty-three times as many
as you have, I don’t see that you have anything
to say to us.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>His account of negro morality was very low,
and he maintained that the negro Churches could
do little to check it, because at least 25 per cent.
of the preachers—in some places a much larger percentage—lived
as loosely as their flocks. I found
other Southern white men of opinion that the influence
of the negro Church was, on the whole, a
bad influence.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it was on the necessity for absolute social
separation between the races that Judge Mansfield
was most emphatic. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“I would Brain him.”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “Jim Crow”
regulations, he declared, are essential
to prevent constant breaches of
the peace. “If a big black man got into the
street-car and pressed up against my wife, I would
brain him!”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>And again: “I was staying with a friend in
Ohio last year—a man of wealth and position—in
a place where there are several well-to-do coloured
people, and where coloured children go to the
same school with the whites. I said to my host,
‘Does your wife take her coloured lady friends
driving with her?’ ‘No.’ ‘Why?’ ‘Oh,
because she doesn’t want to.’ ‘Your boy has a
rig?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Does he ask the coloured girl
friends he made at school to drive out with him?’
‘No.’ ‘Why?’ ‘Oh, he doesn’t want to.’ ‘I’ll
tell you why he doesn’t want to, and you don’t
want him to. It’s because, if he did, the girl’s
brother would come to you, and say, “I want to
marry your daughter”—and you would brain
him!”</p>

<p class='c001'>A third time this phrase occurred in the
Judge’s conversation—I forget the precise context,
but it referred to another instance of negro
presumption.</p>

<p class='c001'>I felt that, after all, the key to the Atlanta
riot was not so far to seek; nor could I feel in the
spirit of Judge Mansfield any absolute guarantee
against the recurrence of such unpleasantnesses.
None the less do I remember him with kindness
and respect. He was as fine a type of the Southern
gentleman of the old school as any I met in my
travels.</p>

<p class='c001'>That evening I spent at Atlanta University
with Mr. W. E. B. Du Bois. Twilight fell as we
stood on the eminence which is crowned by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>University buildings, and looked out over a wide
expanse of red Georgian landscape. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Atlanta University.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The sunset
had left behind it a delicate rosy
flush, and, just where it paled off into
greenish blue, the slender crescent of
a new moon hung in the sky, with a glorious
planet above it. Behind us lay the city, with its
60,000 white men ready to “brain” its 40,000
black and brown men on the slightest provocation.
Before us lay the silent country and the ineffable
peace of heaven. A mood of deep melancholy fell
upon me as I reflected that under the silence of
the country the same passions were vibrating, and
that the peace of heaven was nearer, at any rate
to this generation, than any peace on earth.</p>

<p class='c001'>The influence of the immediate surroundings,
too, had something to do with my mood. About
Atlanta University there is nothing of the cheerful
energy and optimism of Tuskegee. This is a
home of intellectual culture; and intellectual culture,
however necessary, can scarcely be exhilarating
to the negro race at this stage of its history.
The more you strive to break through the veil (to
use Mr. Du Bois’ favourite metaphor), the more
keenly are you conscious of its galling and darkening
encumbrance. For assuredly it galls and
darkens, whether it be a real barrier or a figment
conjured up by the pride and folly of man.</p>

<p class='c001'>At all events, his culture, which is great, and
his genius, which is not small, have not made
of Mr. Du Bois a happy man. With perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>simplicity, without an atom of pose, he is and
remains a singularly tragic figure. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Professor Du Bois.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He is, perhaps,
more impressive than his book, able
as that is. In some of its pages we
are conscious of a little rhetorical
shrillness; but there is nothing of this in the man.
He is perfectly urbane and dignified; there is
nothing of the apostle, and still less of the martyr
about him. He regards and discusses phenomena
with the calm of the trained sociologist. But
beneath his calm one is conscious of a profound
bitterness of spirit. If he is hopeful at all, it is
for a day that he will never see; and, in a man
still in the prime of life, such hope is not very
different from despair.</p>

<p class='c001'>I met no man in the South with whom I felt
more at ease, or seemed to have more in common.
And yet, as we talked, there lurked in my mind a
sense of hypocrisy, almost of treachery. I could
not frankly expose to him my doubts as to whether
the stars in their courses did not fight against his
racial ideal.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of his very interesting conversation I shall
here record only a few fragments.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The problem in the South,” he said (almost
echoing Mr. Shipton, of Louisville), “is not that
of the vagabond or the criminal, but of the negro
who is coming forward. That is why even the
good people of the South are taking their hands
off, saying, ‘We can’t do anything.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“The older generation of negroes had friends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>among the white people of their own age; but the
boys and girls now growing up have no white
friends. The younger white people have no feeling
towards the negro but dislike, founded on
utter lack of comprehension.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The race antipathy is fomented in the schools.
The progressive negro is held up as a bugbear to
the white child, who is told to ‘Look out, or he
will get ahead of you!’ Fear, jealousy, and
hatred are actively taught to the rising generation
of whites. But, after all, they are being taught
<em>something</em>, and that’s more than their fathers were.
Where intelligence increases there is always
hope.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At one point I did come near to hinting to Mr.
Du Bois the doubt lurking in my mind. I quoted
to him this passage from “The Souls of Black
Folk:”</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“Deeply religious and intensely democratic as are the
mass of the whites (in the South), they feel acutely the
false position in which the negro problems place them....
But ... the present social position of the negro stands as
a menace and a portent before even the most open-minded;
if there were nothing to charge against the negro but his
blackness or other physical peculiarities, they argue, the
problem would be comparatively simple; but what can we
say to his ignorance, shiftlessness, poverty, and crime?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>“Now, tell me, Mr. Du Bois,” I said, “whatever
these people may say, is it not really just the
other way about? The ignorance, shiftlessness,
etc., are manifestly temporary and corrigible; is it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>not precisely the ‘blackness and other physical
peculiarities’ that are the true crux of the
problem?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Du Bois smiled. “No,” he said; “that
is the point of view of the outsider, the foreigner.
The Southerner, brought up among negroes, has
no such feeling.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> In using the argument I there
attribute to him he is perfectly sincere.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I refrained from pressing the point, but Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Du Bois’ answer did not quite meet my difficulty.
I had no doubt of the Southerner’s sincerity;
what I questioned was rather his self-knowledge,
or (perhaps I should say) his reading of race
psychology. And that doubt, I own, remains.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the Ethiopian could but change his skin,
how trifling would be the problem raised by his
ignorance, shiftlessness, poverty, and crime!</p>

<hr class='c014' />
<div class='footnote' id='f40'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r40'>40</a>. This typical Southern view is forcibly expressed by Mr. Thomas
Nelson Page: “The history of that period, of the Reconstruction
period of the South, has never been fully told. It is only beginning to
be written. When that history shall be told, it will constitute the
darkest stain on the record of the American people.... They took
eight millions of the Caucasian race, a people which in their devotion
and their self-sacrifice, in their transcendent vigour of intellect, their
intrepid valor in the field, and their fortitude in defeat, had just
elevated their race in the sight of mankind, and placed them under the
domination of their former slaves. There is nothing like it in modern
history.”—“The Negro: the Southerner’s Problem,” pp. 243, 246.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f41'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r41'>41</a>. Another negro writer, Mr. W. H. Thomas (“The American
Negro,” p. 295), is still more emphatic on this point: “That colour is
the prime cause of American prejudice against negroes is not to be
believed for one moment. Every shred of authentic evidence disproves
conclusions so preposterous.” Mr. Thomas goes on to argue that the
condition of “the low class of whites” in the South is “infinitely
inferior to that of the lowest plantation negro.” Somewhat similar is
the view of a clergyman who writes to me from Clyde, Kansas: “The
problem is simply one of <em>caste</em>, and the negro is the extreme example
of the <em>labour caste</em>. The problem is one of aristocracy whatever the
colour of the plebeians.... Whatever its professions, the South is
still pro-slavery. It wants the negro, but it wants him as a slave.
And it would want to enslave any other race that came to take his
place.” Both of these views seem to me so manifestly paradoxical and
excessive that I venture to maintain the position taken up in the text.
At the same time, I would not be understood to mean that the difficulty
lies in colour alone, apart from the “other physical peculiarities.” On
this point a gentleman in Port Arthur, Texas, writes to me: “I have
long had a feeling that negrophobia is not a matter of colour....
No, the thing that rouses a blind disgust—not superficial, not capricious,
but deep-rooted—is the body odour, the flat nose, the thick lips,
the suggestion of ‘slobber’ in the voice and the mouth-movements,
together with the unnatural hair and the animalism of bodily contour
at many points. I have often thought that some accidental discovery
may at any moment put it in the African’s power to remove the dark
pigment from his skin: if this ever happens, it will, I think, be found
that the real repulsiveness of the negroid type has been merely
unveiled, not dissipated.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me take this opportunity of saying that to the best of my belief
the “body odour” of which we hear so much is mainly a superstition.
The fact probably is that the negro ought to be at least as scrupulous
in his ablutions as the white man—but often is not.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>XVI <br /> PROHIBITION</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Every one agrees that the most remarkable phenomenon
in the recent history of the South is the
“wave of prohibition” which has passed, and is
passing, over the country. “There are 20,000,000
people in the fourteen Southern States, 17,000,000
of whom are under prohibitory law in some form.”
“Yes, sir,” says Mr. Dooley, “in the sunny
Southland ’tis as hard to get a dhrink now as it
wanst was not to get wan.... Why, Hinnissy, I
read th’ other day iv a most unfortunate occurrence
down in Texas. A perfectly respectable an’
innocent man, of good connexions, while attemptin’
to dhraw a revolver to plug an inimy, was hastily
shot down be th’ rangers, who thought he was
pullin’ a pocket-flask. Is no man’s life safe
against th’ acts iv irresponsible officers iv the
law?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Georgia led the way in “State-wide” prohibition,
by a law which came into force on January
1, 1908. This law nominally affected only fifteen
counties, since 135 out of the 150 counties in the
State had already “gone dry” under local option.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>But its importance is not to be measured by the
mere number of the counties affected; it lies in
the stoppage of the “jug trade” between “wet”
counties and “dry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Alabama and Mississippi both passed Statewide
prohibition laws which came into force in
January, 1909. A strong fight is being made for
State-wide prohibition in Tennessee, though “all
but five of the ninety-six counties in the State are
now ‘dry’, and only three cities—Memphis, Nashville,
and Chattanooga—remain ‘wet.’” Though
Kentucky has over £30,000,000 invested in distilleries,
the saloon has been expelled from 94 out
of 119 counties, and from the great majority of its
towns and cities. All over the South, in fact,
the same tale is being told—even where Statewide
prohibition cannot as yet be carried, local
option is riddling the defences of the whisky trade.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First-hand Evidence.</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course I made it my business to inquire
into the effects of this great movement, and, of
course, I received many conflicting
answers to my inquiries.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many people told me, just as they
would in England, that “You can’t make a man
sober by Act of Parliament.” They enlarged on
the evils of the “blind tiger,” or illicit saloon.
They sang to me the refrain:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hush, little grog-shop, don’t you cry:</div>
      <div class='line'>You’ll be a drug-store by-and-by!“</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>They told me of the “clubs” where each member
can keep his private locker full of alcohol, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>get drunk at his leisure. As for drink and the
negro (they said), what is the use of keeping
whisky out of his way, when in ten cents’ worth
of a “patent medicine” he can find enough cocaine
to make him more dangerous than could a gallon
of whisky?</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, I was told of a State in
which the gaol-keepers, who (strange to say) made
their living out of catering for the prisoners under
their charge, applied for a special “grant-in-aid”
on the ground that prohibition had so depopulated
their preserves that they could no longer keep
body and soul together.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, though I believe it to be true, sounded
a little like a fairy-tale; so I thought I would go
to headquarters for exact information. Atlanta
was the only city I visited where prohibition was
actually in force; so I betook me to Decatur Street
Police-court, in the middle of its lowest quarters.
I arrived at a fortunate moment: it happened to
be the first of May, and Mr. Preston, the Clerk of
the Court, was just making up his statistics for
April. He took the trouble of looking up the
records of the previous year for me, and gave me
the following figures:</p>

<p class='c001'>Number of cases tried in the first four months
of 1907 (before prohibition), 6056.</p>

<p class='c001'>Number of cases tried in the first four months
of 1908 (after prohibition), 3139.</p>

<p class='c001'>Convictions for drunkenness before prohibition,
1955.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Convictions for drunkenness after prohibition,
471.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Take it all round,” said Mr. Preston, “our
work has been reduced by just about one-half.”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>I afterwards attended a sitting of this Court
(Judge Broyle’s), when, in a very light calendar,
there was not a single case of drunkenness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oddly enough, no distinction of colour seemed
to appear on the records, but I gathered that
about 75 per cent. of the prisoners who come
before Judge Broyle were negroes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the negroes to whom I spoke of prohibition,
all but one were strongly in its favour. That one,
Dr. Oberman of Memphis, thought that more real
good would be done by a “high licence.” Mr.
Millard, of Montgomery, was emphatic in his
approval. “I believe we’re the ones that are
going to get the biggest part of the bargain,“ he
said. “My people are going to have better homes
and look after their families better—to pay for
their schooling and pay their bills.” It is only fair
to point out, however, that this was pure prophecy,
since in Montgomery prohibition had not then
come into force.</p>

<p class='c001'>Being myself but a small consumer of alcohol,
I was not irresistibly impelled to study the various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>methods of evading the liquor laws. One mild
evasion of them I did come across at one of the
“Country Clubs” which are such a
delightful adjunct to American city
life. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Club Law.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Here each member could by law have his
locker; but it was found an intolerable nuisance to
carry the system literally into effect. So, as a matter
of fact, drinks did not come from any individual
locker; they were supplied from the club cellar
in the ordinary way; only the club must not be
paid for them, since that would be a confession that
the member ordering them had not stored them
for his own use. What, then, was the method
adopted? Members bought of the club books of
ten-cent coupons, and with these coupons they
paid the waiters who brought the drinks—not for
the drinks, but for their services in bringing them!
It appeared to me a complex and rather childish
fiction, but probably it was no one’s business to
look into its seams.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was at this club that a Senator from an
adjoining State, who had been very active in the
prohibition campaign, was found one day seated
before a “high-ball” of imposing dimensions. On
being reproached for inconsistency, he replied:
“Prohibition is for the masses, not for the classes.”
A most un-American sentiment, some will say;
but to my thinking characteristically American.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Savannah, Georgia, 147 “locker clubs”
were organized the day after prohibition came
into force, one of them, a negro club, numbering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>1700 members. But it will not be long before
this evasion is dealt with. It is held by able
jurists that, even under the present law, such
clubs are illegal. In the mean time, I suppose
they exist in Atlanta no less than in Savannah;
yet, as we have seen, the work of the police court
has been reduced by one-half.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for “blind tigers,” there is no doubt that
they follow in the track of prohibition laws, and
that it is fairly easy, for those who
know how, to procure bad liquor at
high prices. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The “Blind Tiger.”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But in the first place
you have got to “know how;” in the second
place, even for those who know how, it costs
more time, trouble, and money than it did of old,
to attain the requisite exhilaration; in the third
place, “blind tigers” can, and do, have their
claws pared now and then. Most of the people I
spoke to, at all events, admitted that the evils of
the “blind tiger” are not to be compared with
the constant temptations offered by the open
saloon.</p>

<p class='c001'>That these evils are serious enough, however,
appears from the following brief paragraph which
I cut from the <cite>Atlanta Constitution</cite>:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>KILLED AT A BLIND TIGER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Nashville (Tenn.), April 29.—“At a blind tiger on
Knott Creek, Kentucky, Henry Pratt, a thirteen-year-old
schoolboy, shot and killed Howard Maunds, also aged
thirteen. The boys were intoxicated, and the killing
followed a game of cards.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>During the days I was in Atlanta, five blind-tiger
keepers were prosecuted and “bound over
under bonds to the city court,” one in the sum of
£200, the rest in sums of £100. What this
“binding over” precisely means I cannot say, but
it seems to be a painful process to the animals in
question, for I read that “their howls filled the
court.”</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the persons “bound over” was a doctor.
It was noticed that his practice had of late
increased enormously. A stream of patients
resorted to his office at all hours of the day, till
at last a plain-clothes officer joined the stream.
The doctor told him that he was out of whisky,
but could fix up a good substitute, which proved to
be some form of alcohol, tinctured with syrup,
to take away the crude taste. Of this beverage
the officer purchased two half-pints at two different
times, and then ungratefully arrested his
benefactor.</p>

<p class='c001'>On another occasion a plain-clothes officer was
told off to watch a house where it was suspected
that an illicit trade was carried on. Near it he
came upon a negro lounging against a fence.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nager,” said the constable, “do you know
where a fellow can get a quart of good whisky?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Naw, sir, I don’t; but mebbe I kin find
some,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c001'>The constable handed him a dollar and a half,
and told him to see what he could do.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yessir,” said the negro. “Just you hold this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>shoe-box for me while I step down the street a
piece.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The policeman held the carefully wrapped
shoe-box, while his emissary disappeared round
the corner. For half an hour he waited in vain,
then searched the neighbourhood up and down,
and returned to the station enraged at having let
himself be victimized. But when he investigated
the shoe-box, expecting to find it full of
rubbish, behold! it contained a quart bottle of
whisky.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such are the dodges to which the liquor-trade
is reduced. But however manifold and ingenious
its sleights, I cannot be persuaded that it is so
easy to get drunk in Atlanta as it is in New
Orleans, with its 2000 open saloons—to say
nothing of cities nearer home.</p>

<p class='c001'>South Carolina was for some time, and is still
partially, under the “dispensary” system, the
State undertaking the function of providing
its citizens with alcohol. The dispensary is
open only during limited hours, and no liquor
may be drunk on the premises. This system
has proved the reverse of satisfactory from the
point of view of the temperance reformer, while
corruption has fleeced the State of hundreds
of thousands of dollars in the purchase of its
liquors.</p>

<p class='c001'>There have been “waves” of prohibition in
America before, which have more or less receded
as time went on. Will that be the history
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>of this wave? The best authorities do not
think so.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Has Prohibition Come to Stay?</div>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, as I have said
before, the South is deeply and
earnestly religious. The Churches
are all opposed to the liquor traffic, and it has
been said that “a proposition to restore it
would encounter from them almost the same
reception as a proposition to restore a State
Church establishment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the second place, the presence of the negro
in the South is a tower of strength to the prohibitionist.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the third place, the rapid industrial revival
of the South is making men alive to the economic
waste involved in the liquor traffic.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the fourth place, prohibition has touched
the patriotic imagination of the South, which is
a very lively faculty indeed.</p>

<p class='c001'>On this subject I spoke to Dr. E. A. Alderman,
President of the University of Virginia. In that
State local option has banished the saloon from
almost all the country districts and from most
of the towns. Charlottesville, the seat of the
University, is, according to Dr. Alderman,
distinctly a better town since it “went dry.”
Manners are better, the standard of comfort is
higher, there is more money to spend.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It seems to me,” said Dr. Alderman, “that
society has an absolute right to protect itself
against the evils of alcohol, just as it has the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>right to take compulsory measures of sanitation.
Whether the best method of protection has as
yet been reached, I won’t undertake to say.
But I think you may safely assume that in the
Southern States the age of the open grog-shop is
past.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f42'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r42'>42</a>. In <cite>Atlanta University Publications</cite>, No. IX. p. 49 (published in
1904, when as yet prohibition seemed scarcely within the range of
practical politics), I find the following remarkable prophecy: “The
fountain-head of crime among the negroes of Atlanta is the open saloon.
There is no doubt but that the removal of strong drink from the city
would decrease crime by half.”</p>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>XVII <br /> THE NEGRO HOME AND THE NEGRO CHURCH</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Wherever I went in the South, one invariable
experience awaited me, of which I scarcely know
how to write. A buggy was ordered out, and I
was trotted round to visit six or eight negro
“homes.” I came to regard it as an established
ritual, and learned to use the responses expected
of me.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be base and stupid were I to laugh
at these simple people who, in all good faith,
and with a touching pride, which one felt to be
more racial than personal, displayed to me their
household gods. As a rule, indeed, I felt much
more inclined to weep than to laugh. And yet,
in one aspect, the parade was irresistibly ludicrous.
It was as though one were led from window to
window in Tottenham Court Road and asked to
read, in the dining-room, drawing-room, and bedroom
“suites,” the capacity of the British people
for culture and civilization.</p>

<p class='c001'>The point, of course, was to show what progress
the coloured race had made, in wealth, education,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>and refinement, during the forty years which had
elapsed since their emancipation. Statistics on
this point, as we have seen, are apt to be a little
deceptive. It is generally assumed that, after the
Civil War, the race as a whole started in absolute
pauperism. But this is not the fact. There were
at that time many free negroes, and not a few who
possessed a good deal of property.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a> Thus the
well-to-do, “home”-owning class of negroes is
not entirely a creation of the past forty years.
In Charleston, for instance, there were a good
many negro slave-holders before the war; and I
was told (though for this I should not like to
vouch) that negro property-owners are now fewer
in that city than they had once been, many of
the younger generation having dissipated the
savings of their elders. I may add that by far
the most homelike of the homes I visited belonged
to a professional man who could not truly be said
to have risen from slavery.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless, the evidence of thrift and
material prosperity among a considerable class
of negroes is undeniable and very striking. As
I was driven from home to home, other homes
and institutions were pointed out to me, with
details as to the number of dollars they represented,
until my head swam, and I began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>wonder whether I were not back among the
Vanderbilts and Goulds in Fifth Avenue. For
when you get well up among the tens of thousands,
my power of grasping and comparing numbers
very soon fails me.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The greater part of this street here to the
left belongs to the richest man in our community.
He pays taxes on half a million dollars.” “There
are three or four homes in this street belonging
to coloured people worth from 25,000 to 75,000
dollars.” “That is an infirmary for negroes
donated by a carpenter who couldn’t read or
write. It cost 50,000 dollars. It is supported
by various coloured clubs, with contributions from
the county and the city.” Such was the unvaried
strain as the buggy rattled along.</p>

<p class='c001'>But one thing I noticed with interest—my
coloured cicerones were just as ready to point
with pride to the fine residences and institutions
of white men as to the homes of their own people.
Whatever their grounds of complaint against the
other race, they were, so far as they were suffered
to be, loyal citizens of their State.</p>

<p class='c001'>To one negro Cr&oelig;sus I was personally introduced,
and an interesting type he was. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Coloured Carnegie.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> An old
man—well on in the sixties, I should
say. He had no negro traits that
I could discover, and his complexion
was the very lightest yellow. His shrewd, many-wrinkled,
crab-apple face would have been remarked
in Europe as distinctly American, but he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>would scarcely have been suspected of black blood.
In one respect he was ostentatiously millionairish,
for every tooth in his head was of gold. Moreover,
he wore in his shirt front a splendid diamond pin,
which contrasted oddly with his otherwise plain
and even rustic attire.</p>

<p class='c001'>He is a banker, a general trader, an owner of
real estate—and a liberal benefactor to his own
people. He has established in the negro quarter
of the city where he lives a sort of garden and
recreation-ground for his race, which is all the
more appreciated, as negroes, even when not
formally excluded from the public parks, are
made very unwelcome in them. In the recreation
ground is a plain but well-designed and commodious
wooden theatre, where companies of
negro actors frequently appear. I am told there
is a remarkable development of negro theatrical
art in several quarters, but was not fortunate
enough to come across any specimens of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The keen little walnut-skinned Carnegie-Chrysostom
accompanied my guide and me over
the garden and theatre. He said very little, but
he gleamed appreciation of my guide’s remarks,
all tending to impress on me his manifold activities,
his astuteness, his success, and his beneficence.
Yet one did not feel, as one would have felt had
a white millionaire been concerned, that the
poorer man was guilty of adulation, the richer
of ostentation. There was something impersonal
about it all. It was not the men but the race
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>who boasted. The hero of the song of praise was
not “I,” nor “he,” but “we.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And what, now, of the “homes” themselves?
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Villa Residences.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Those that I saw were without exception what
are called by English house-agents
suburban villa residences, which
would command, in the neighbourhood
of London, rents of from £40 to £70 a year.
They were very nice little houses, scrupulously
neat and well kept. They had (to my mind) the
advantage over English houses of the same class,
in the sense of spaciousness which comes with
steam-heat and the consequent absence of doors.
In some the doorways were filled with bead curtains—hanging
strings of glass beads—which seem
to be very popular just now in coloured society.</p>

<p class='c001'>The furniture was always modern and in
excellent condition, with a great deal of plush
about it. Much of it conveyed the impression
(not uncommon in English villa residences) of
being intended rather for show than use. The
wall-papers ran to large patterns, and were apt
to be sombre in tint. Every home, without
exception, had its piano, sometimes with open
music on it. In the matter of pictures, nicknacks,
etc., there was no affectation of “culture.”
Æstheticism—that “unanimity of æsthetic appreciations”
which so troubled Mr. Wells in Boston—has
not yet penetrated the negro home. I did
not see a single Wingless Victory. The works
of art are simple to the point of primitiveness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>and pleasing in so far as they genuinely represent
the taste of their owners. One handsomely
furnished parlour stands out in my memory, in
which a showy overmantel was flanked by two
amazing glass transparencies in heavy gilt frames,
one representing a moonlit landscape and the
other the Houses of Parliament and Clock Tower
at Westminster.</p>

<p class='c001'>As a rule, I would be received by the lady of
the house (her husband was apt to be away at
business) with the stock phrases of American
politeness. In the great majority of cases the
lady would be a quadroon, or lighter; and in one
or two instances I fancy nature had been assisted
by a whiff of the powder-puff. My inspection
generally stopped short at the living-rooms on
the ground floor; but sometimes I was admitted
to regions of more intimate domesticity. It was
embarrassing; it was ludicrous; it was, above all,
pathetic.</p>

<p class='c001'>With people of a corresponding class in
England the first impulse would have been to
offer a visitor “refreshment” of some sort.
Never once was there a hint of anything of
the kind on the part of my negro hosts. I
wondered, and am still wondering, whether it
simply was not the custom of the country, or
whether they imagined that I would scruple to
eat or drink with them.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Though I did not partake of their bread and
salt, I have a sense of perfidy in thus criticizing
the interiors in which they took such
a simple pride. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Resolute Refinement.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But, after all, I was
there for no other purpose than to
report what I saw and felt. What I felt, then,
was certainly admiration for the thrift and progressiveness
which were apparent on every hand;
nor was it the unsophisticated order of taste displayed
in furniture and adornment that qualified
my admiration. Far be it from me to attribute
any absolute superiority to the standards of Brixton,
or even of Boston. What troubled me throughout
my domiciliary visits was the sense that (with
one or two exceptions) these homes were not
homes at all. I do not doubt that each roof
sheltered a home; but I do not believe that the
prim parlours I saw had any essential connection
with it. They were no more homelike than the
shopwindow rooms of the up-to-date upholsterer.
If they were lived in at all, it was from a sense
of duty, a self-conscious effort after a life of
“refinement.” They were, in short, entirely
imitative and mechanical tributes to the American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>ideal of the prosperous, cultivated home. I could
find in them no real expression of the individuality
of their inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let it be remembered, however, that this is
the first generation of negro prosperity. Will the
second or third generation really assimilate the
American ideal, or develop a “refined” domesticity
of its own?</p>

<p class='c001'>A remark of my guide on one of these
expeditions summed up the phase of culture as
I saw it. “We have a little whist club in our
set,” he <a id='corr163.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='set'>said</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_163.12'><ins class='correction' title='set'>said</ins></a></span>. “We meet and play once a month.
But the best part of it is the good dinner at the
end of the season.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The whist club, so frankly characterized, guided
me to the word I had been searching for in the
back of my mind through all these experiences.
It was the word “veneer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A very different class of negro was represented
in the congregation of the only church which I
had an opportunity of attending.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>African Methodism.</div>

<p class='c001'>It was an African Methodist
church—a spacious, airy building,
capable, I should think, of seating some 2000
people. It was not full, but fairly well attended;
and black, as distinct from brown or yellow, was
the prevailing complexion. Every one was quite
decently dressed, some of the women in gaudy
colours, but many of them, too, in black. The
gaudiest colours were in the awful stained-glass
windows, which seemed to be made of salvage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>from the wreck of a cheap kaleidoscope. Two
pastors sat on a platform at the end of the hall.
There were flowers on a table before them; and,
as it was a sweltering morning, each of them held
a fan.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole service was conducted by one of
them, a man of rather Caucasian features, but of
dark-brown tint. In the hymn-singing there was
nothing peculiar—it was fairly spirited and good.
But after the first few sentences of the prayer,
ejaculations began to break forth. Their precise
meaning, if they had any, I did not catch. They
seemed to me like “Yes, oh yes!” They ought,
according to the best authorities, to have been
“Hallelujah!” “Praise de Lord!” and such
phrases; but I certainly did not distinguish them.
And presently they grew quite inarticulate, passing
over into wails, moans, and now and then a sort of
wild, maniac laughing and yodelling.</p>

<p class='c001'>And the whole sermon, after the first five
minutes, was accompanied by similar manifestations.
The text was, “Blessed are they that do
hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they
shall be filled.” I have heard many worse sermons
than this competent, fluent, popular discourse,
which consisted mainly of an exposition of the
overpowering strength of the metaphor of “hunger
and thirst.” “We may credit our backs,” said
the preacher, “but we must pay our stomachs;
we can put the back off, but we can’t put off the
stomach.” (“Yes, oh yes!” shouts, moans, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>wails.) “No doubt most of you, before you came
here, have had a good drink of coffee or tea; but
how many of you have had a real good drink from
the fountain of everlasting life?” (Confused sounds
not unlike the yelpings of a large kennel.) “If
some of you didn’t eat and drink more physically
than you do spiritually, you’d be skeletons. That’s
plain talk.” (Shrieks, wails, and yodelling.)
“Some of you good sisters are so anxious to get
your people’s breakfasses that you have no time
to ask a blessing on the work of the day.” (“Hu!
hu!” “Bless de Lord!”—for once articulate—moans,
and shrieks.)</p>

<p class='c001'>These are but fragments of the discourse, which
lasted half an hour. What particularly interested
me, both in the prayer and the sermon, was the
action and reaction between speaker and audience.
Never once did he take any notice of the wild
sounds, as a political speaker would almost necessarily
have done. I do not remember that he even
paused for them; his rhetoric seemed to flow
smoothly on. In other words, he did not openly
“play to the gallery.” Yet there is no doubt that
the hysterical cries and ululations were of value
to him. He worked them up, and they worked
him up. It must not be understood, however,
that anything like the whole congregation joined
in the noises. They seemed all to proceed from
two or three definite points in the hall. One
could almost have supposed them the prearranged
paroxysms of an epileptic claque.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>I stole out, under cover of a hymn, at the end
of the sermon, not sorry to find myself once more
in America. In the church (where I was the
only white or even approximately white person
present) I could not but feel that I was in Africa—slightly
veneered.</p>

<hr class='c014' />
<div class='footnote' id='f43'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r43'>43</a>. See pp. 33 and 35. Mr. A. H. Stone declares to be “fallacies”
the two widely-accepted opinions “that the negro began life forty years
ago with nothing but his freedom, and that the period of his emancipation
has been one of marvellous economic achievement.”—“The

<p class='c001'><a href='#r44'>44</a>. Mr. Kelly Miller (coloured), author of “Race Adjustment,” in
an open letter to Mr. Thomas Dixon, Junr., says: “You will doubtless
remember that when I addressed the Congregational Ministers in New
York City, you asked permission to be present ... although you beat
a precipitous retreat when luncheon was announced.” At the invitation
of Professor Du Bois, I had the great pleasure of dining one evening
with the (coloured) students of Atlanta University; and at Tuskegee I
was most hospitably entertained in the house of the Principal. The
(white) instructors at Hampton Institute take their meals apart from
the students. For a cruel instance of “discrimination” in hospitality,

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>XVIII <br /> CHARLESTON</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>For any disappointment I had felt in New Orleans,
Charleston more than compensated me. Mr.
Owen Wister, in “Lady Baltimore,” has in no
way exaggerated its charm.</p>

<p class='c001'>In situation it is not at all unlike New York,
being built on a tongue of land between the broad
estuaries of the Ashley and the Cooper Rivers.
At the tip of the tongue (as in New York) is the
Battery; but here the Battery is a beautiful, semi-tropical
garden, full of live-oaks, palmettos, and
flowering shrubs, with an esplanade overlooking
the blue expanse of the harbour, the historic Fort
Sumter and Fort Moultrie, and the low shores
beyond. This garden is a fascinating spot. I
returned to it again and again during my stay in
the city. Passing up Meeting Street (the Broadway
of Charleston), one finds, instead of the skyscrapers
which shoulder one another in the lower
end of New York, the simple, dignified old houses
of a vanishing generation of Southern aristocrats,
each standing end-on to the street, in its little
plot of lawn and flowering shrubs. The typical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Charlestonian house is a plain two or three storey
structure, entirely surrounded at each level with
broad verandahs and balconies. In several cases
the floor area of verandah and balcony outside
the walls must at least equal the floor area of the
rooms inside the walls. Now, spacious verandahs
always suggest to the mind the lazy luxury of a
genial summer-land, deep lounging-chairs, cool
drinks, and the glow of cigar-tips in the twilight.
I am bound to say that I saw very little of this
sort of life proceeding in the verandahs of
Charleston; but that only enabled one all the
more easily to people them with the ghosts of
fifty years ago, before the guns of Fort Moultrie
startled their calm. In Charleston I felt, almost
for the first time, that the romance of the Old
South had once been a reality. All of the South
that I had hitherto seen had been remorselessly
new.</p>

<p class='c001'>Further up-town (as they would say in New
York) the streets of Charleston become more
commonplace, but always retain a character of
their own. There is not a vestige of a sky-scraper
in the whole peninsula. On the other hand, the
city is dotted with old churches of the Wren style,
each with its quiet burial-ground around it. Close
to St. Michael’s Church and in front of the City
Hall, is a sadly mutilated statue of the elder Pitt.
It was erected in 1770, and its mutilation was
begun by a British cannon-ball in 1780.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me add that Charleston, like New Orleans,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>is proud of its cemeteries, and with much better
reason. Magnolia Cemetery, with its live-oaks and
its little lake, is a really lovely garden. One
historic live-oak of enormous size, draped in
Spanish moss and with exquisite little ferns growing
along each of its huge boughs, is not only a
wonderful but an extraordinarily beautiful tree.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to the population of Charleston my informants
differed. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“No Trouble.”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A white man placed it at 60,000 in
all, with 40,000 negroes; a negro at
65,000, with 33,000 negroes. As
there has been no census since 1900, probably no
one knows exactly; but it seems to be admitted
that the blacks more or less considerably outnumber
the whites. The white people, by their
own account, pay nine-tenths of the taxes; the
negroes aver that their real estate is assessed at a
million and a half dollars—assessment representing
only about 60 per cent. of actual value. Both
statements are very likely true.</p>

<p class='c001'>White Charleston plumes itself on a peculiar
and hereditary understanding of the negro, and
knowledge of the way to deal with him; whence
it happens that there has been “no trouble”—no
outrages or lynchings—in or around the city.
Moreover, I was assured that negroes were
employed in the police force, and that not long
ago there was a black lieutenant of police, with
white men under him.</p>

<p class='c001'>But mark how the aspect of things alters
according to the point of view from which they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>regarded! When I mentioned to a little group of
leading negroes this proof of the equal treatment
accorded to the two races, I observed on their
countenances an expressive smile. On inquiring
its reason, I learned that there were indeed three
coloured policemen out of a total force of 106; that
they and a few others had been appointed at some
long-past period of political compromise; and that,
when they die off, there is not the smallest chance
of their being replaced by men of colour. “Here,
as elsewhere, the Irish control the police force;
and the Irish hate us worse than the native
Americans.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was an odd group, this coloured conclave
in which I found myself. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Negro and his Vote.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Only one member (a
doctor) was dark-brown in complexion;
two were very light-brown;
while two others, again, were indistinguishable
from white men. One reminded me
strongly of a choleric old Scotch General whom I
once knew; the other was very English in type,
with smooth, silvery hair (prematurely white), and
a large, round, placid, bovine face. Meeting him
in England, you would have said he was a trifle
sunburnt.</p>

<p class='c001'>Their talk was mainly of their political grievances,
and the various methods by which their race,
all over the Southern States, were jockeyed out of
their votes. Much of what they said I failed to
follow; with a good deal of it, on the other hand,
I was already pretty familiar.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>The different States of the South have adopted
methods differing in many details for excluding
incompetent and undesirable voters from the polls;
but the general principle has always been much
the same. It has been to impose some slight test
of education and intelligence (generally to read
and explain some paragraph of the Constitution)
on all who desire to have their names placed on
the register.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>If these tests were applied equally to the two
races, the negro would have no ground of complaint.
But exceptions are made in favour of the
whites in the very laws establishing the tests.
Most of them contain clauses analogous to what
is known in Alabama as the “grandfather
clause,” which provides that illiteracy shall not
bar any one whose father or grandfather was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>entitled to vote at the outbreak of the Civil
War. This exception is defended on the ground
that even an illiterate person of the original Anglo-Saxon
stock (the South is nothing if not Anglo-Saxon)
is generally a very shrewd fellow, and
eminently capable of exercising the franchise.
Under the “grandfather clause,” then, only illiterate
aliens and illiterate negroes are excluded from
the register; and this discrimination is naturally
resented by the negro.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if the matter stopped there, the black race
would not feel themselves so very much aggrieved.
The real burden of their complaint is not the
inequality of the laws, but the inequality of their
administration. The tests of intelligence are
applied (they declare) by unscrupulous registrars,
who will ask a white man some simple question,
such as whether imprisonment for debt is permitted,
while they will pose a negro with some
impossible technicality concerning a bill of attainder
or an estate in tail. The upshot is that admission
to the register depends entirely on the arbitrary
will and pleasure of the registrars. Their decisions
can be appealed against, but the appeal is said to
be practically useless.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor is this all. When a negro happens to be
a man of such property, education, and position
that it is absolutely impossible to reject his vote,
there is always the last resource of omitting to
count it. One of the Charleston group spoke of
a particular election in which he himself, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>others of his people to his certain knowledge, cast
Republican ballots; but the result, as announced,
showed not a single Republican vote.</p>

<p class='c001'>On this matter, as on so many others, it is
very hard to get at the truth. White men aver,
and will prove by statistics, that in proportion
to his taxation the negro has very fair voting
power, and is freely permitted to exercise it.
But I met no single negro who would admit
this; and most of them, like my Charleston
friends, were very bitter on the question, as well
as on the exclusion of even the most respectable
of their race from the councils, the “machine,”
of their party.</p>

<p class='c001'>A remark made by one of this very intelligent
Charleston group struck me as a curious comment
on the belief of white Charleston that it has a
special genius for dealing with the black race.
“We negroes,” said this member of the race,
“have no respect for the Southern white man’s
opinions or his prophecies. He has always prophesied
wrong. This thing is going to work out
in the usual mysterious way, that the South
will be very much surprised over.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I quote word for word. “The usual mysterious
way” may seem an odd phrase, but its meaning
is not very far to seek.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Charleston, under the guidance of a genial
Southern gentleman placed in high educational
authority, I saw a good deal both of white and
of coloured schools. My guide was an enthusiast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>for negro education. “What’s the good,” he said,
“of talking about being a superior race if you’re
afraid to educate the negro? <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>White Negroes.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> There’s
not much superiority in that.” He
admitted with regret that accommodation
for negro children was very deficient, and
said that those who were fighting for better
accommodation had been crippled by the recent
appointment of a negro to a Federal office in
the town.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a school containing twelve hundred black
children, the fire alarm was given, and in exactly
three minutes every child was in the playground,
the whole school being ranged in “column of
companies,” or, rather, of classes. Assuredly,
such discipline cannot but be salutary. It was
in this school too, that I heard five hundred negro
children (most of them quite small, for three-fourths
of them drop out after passing through
the primary classes) singing in their clear, shrill
voices—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In Dixie Land</div>
      <div class='line'>I take my stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>To live and die in Dixie.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Poor quaint little mortals! They were unconscious
of any irony in the sentiment.</p>

<p class='c001'>In every negro school or college that I visited—at
Tuskegee among the rest—I saw several
young people in whom my eye could not discern
the slightest trace of black blood.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c013'><sup>[46]</sup></a> But it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>in Charleston, at an endowed school for negroes,
that the most remarkable instance of this kind
came under my notice. I was present at the
morning muster of the whole school; and while
the hymn was being sung I could not take my
eyes off two boys of thirteen or fourteen, evidently
brothers, who stood side by side in one of the
upper classes. They were not only white, but
(one would have said) peculiarly and resplendently
white. Their features were delicate and distinguished,
their eyes blue or grey, their hair a
light brown. They were slightly built, and,
although their dress was quite plain, they had
somehow an air of grace and breeding. They
could have gone to Eton or Winchester and
excited no remark.</p>

<p class='c001'>Shall I confess that the contrast between these
boys and the ebony and chocolate manikins among
whom their lot was cast stirred in me the race
instinct in all its unreasoning crudity? I wanted
to swoop down upon them and rescue them from
what I felt for the moment to be their horrible
and unnatural surroundings. They seemed to
me like children in a fairy-tale, carried off by
some tribe of brownies or gnomes. And who
shall say, indeed, that the impulse to rescue them
was wholly quixotic? If they remain in America,
there can be no doubt that the life that lies
before them will be one of painful misunderstandings,
heart burnings, and humiliations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before leaving Charleston, let me record a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>curious little street-car incident. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Street-car Incident.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Coloured people,
in this city, are not confined to a special part
of the car; but, each seat being
designed to accommodate two passengers,
a coloured person and white
person must not sit side by side on the same seat.
One afternoon I was in a car which was full save
for one place. The foremost seat on the left hand
was occupied by one negro girl, and there was, of
course, a vacant place at her side. Presently
a white woman got in and sat down in this place.
“Hallo!” I thought, “here is a violation of the
rule,”—and I wondered what would happen. The
conductor was equal to the occasion. The foremost
right-hand seat was occupied by a cadet of
the Charleston Military Academy in his neat grey
uniform, and by a lady. The conductor touched
the cadet on the shoulder and whispered to him.
The young man at once stood up, the white
woman who had last entered the car transferred
herself to his place, and for the rest of the journey
the cadet hung on to the strap, while the seat
beside the negro girl remained vacant!</p>

<p class='c001'>In several States, according to Mr. E. G. Murphy (“The Present
South,” p. 198), “Many negroes have been discouraged from offering
to register by reason of the fact that the State organization of the party
with which they have been associated recently refused to admit even
their most respected representatives to its Conventions. [This is the
‘lily-white’ policy referred to by Mr. Shipton, p. 34.] Large numbers
have also refrained from registration because of their unwillingness to
meet the poll-tax requirement. The interest of the masses of the
negroes in things political has, for quite different reasons, been much
exaggerated by the representatives of both parties.”</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>XIX <br /> THE FRINGE OF FLORIDA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>At Charleston I was in some sense at a parting of
the ways. In order to attend the Educational
Conference at Memphis I had been compelled to
leave out Virginia and North Carolina from the
itinerary I had originally planned. Should I now
return to New York, repairing this omission—taking
Raleigh, Richmond, the Hampton Institute,
and other interesting places, on my way? Or
should I set my face once more southward, and
return to England by way of the West Indies?</p>

<p class='c001'>Several considerations determined me in favour
of the latter course. Chief among them, perhaps,
was the desire to visit the southernmost portion
of the United States—a portion unknown to the
past, but destined to figure largely in the history
of the future—the Canal Zone of Panama.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still, then, my motto was “Southward Ho!”</p>

<p class='c001'>A slight misadventure frustrated my design of
paying a short visit to Savannah. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>St. Augustine.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> At Jacksonville,
the capital of Florida, I
stayed just long enough to find it
intolerably hot and excessively uninteresting;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>though here, as almost everywhere else on the
east coast of Florida, a magnificent sheet of water
(the St. John’s River) compensates for the monotony
of the surrounding country.</p>

<p class='c001'>I hurried on to St. Augustine, with its huge
and really picturesque hotels (the Alcazar and the
Ponce de Leon), its narrow, semi-Spanish streets,
its fine old fort of the Vauban period, its beautiful
lagoon, and (on Anastasia Island) its glorious
stretch of silver-white ocean beach. But there
was no temptation to linger anywhere in Florida,
for the hotels were all shut up and the season was
entirely over. I can imagine that, in the season,
the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Plaza de la Constitucion</span> at St. Augustine
is a busy and amusing spot. But no one could
explain to me why the great hotels, instead of being
placed in view of the bay or (still better) of the
open sea, were huddled together, on no “situation”
at all, in the centre of the little town.
There is no doubt some reason for this; but it
passed my divining.</p>

<p class='c001'>Onward, then, by the Florida East Coast Railway,
which is, if I am rightly informed, practically
the undivided property of Mr. Flagler,
a Standard Oil magnate. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The American Riviera.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> (I
heard the Governor of the State,
Mr. Broward, deliver an attack on its monopolist
pretensions in the Plaza at St. Augustine.) With
a few hours’ pause at Daytona, I went right on to
Miami, which was, till lately, the terminus of the
railway—366 miles from Jacksonville.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Undoubtedly this margin of the great peninsula—this
Riviera of the United States—has a charm
of its own. Physically, however, nothing could
be less like the Riviera. Here there are no Alps,
no Esterels. There is not even a molehill that
can be magnified into a mountain. It is a region
of broad skies and broad waters, green scrub, and
leagues on leagues of smooth, white beach, with
the blue ocean curling idly over it. Apart from
gardens and a very few neglected orange groves,
I saw absolutely not one patch of cultivation
between St. Augustine and Miami. The railroad
would pass through miles of tangled scrub and
acres of dwarf palmetto; the most dreary and
monotonous country imaginable. Then suddenly
a blue lagoon would open out, with delightful,
low, board-veranda’d houses skirting it, and
rich tropical gardens running down to the water’s
edge. Then into the wilderness again, with only
here and there a clearance and a cabin, and here
and there, I grieve to say, acres of beautiful pine-trees
bleeding to death for the enrichment of
some turpentine company.</p>

<p class='c001'>Miami—known to the natives as My-ammy—has
the air of a busy and prosperous frontier
town. It has the usual huge hotel, unusually
well situated, at the junction between a beautiful
river and a beautiful lagoon. Here we are quite
clearly on the very verge of the tropics—coco-nut
palms abound on every hand; coco-nut husks
cumber the white shell roads; the gardens are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>full of hybiscus and other splendid flowering
shrubs; and everywhere the gorgeous poinsiana
regia flames in unabashed vermilion against the
deep blue of the sky.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An Ocean-going Railroad.</div>

<p class='c001'>A wonderful piece of engineering is the railway
over the Florida Keys—the low margin of islands,
like those of the upper Adriatic, in
which the peninsula tails off. By
this time it may be completed all
the way from Miami to Key West; but when I
was there it had a half-way terminus at Knight’s
Key.</p>

<p class='c001'>For an hour after leaving Miami the railway
runs through an almost unbroken pine forest.
Here and there a rude cabin is visible, occupied,
no doubt by platelayers; but there is not a single
clearing or attempt at cultivation. Then, all of
a sudden, the forest ceases, and we emerge upon
open swamp prairies, dotted with clumps of low
green scrub. To the north we can see the edge
of the pine forest running off, like a black wall,
into the dim distance. For another hour or thereabouts
we trail through the coarse grass of the
swamp prairies or salt marshes, broken only by
occasional channels of water. Of habitation or
cultivation there is no sign. Then we run out
upon vast lagoons dotted with occasional scrub-covered
islands. The railroad is built on a piled-up
causeway of a sort of white shell-limestone—or is
it, perhaps, coral?</p>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, the outlook is rather monotonous;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>but there are patches of beauty. I remember
vividly a huge green lagoon, with a low green
shore beyond; in the foreground some sort of
heron lazily flapping its way over the surface;
and in the distance the white sails of a fore-and-aft
schooner shining in the sun.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then we pass through many miles of amazing
and fantastic jungle. No tree, perhaps, is over
thirty feet high; but all are <a id='corr181.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='stangely'>strangely</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_181.9'><ins class='correction' title='stangely'>strangely</ins></a></span> contorted
and interwoven with vines and creepers—like the
forest round the Sleeping Beauty’s castle. A few
clearings are burnt away in this jungle, and things
like banana trees are growing in them. But for
an hour and a half after leaving Homestead (the
station at the edge of the pine forest) I saw
not a single human habitation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Soon, however, we begin to catch occasional
glimpses of the open sea—iridescent and exquisite—through
gaps in the outer barrier of reefs. And
now there are one or two houses to be seen. We
stop at what seems to be a station. Some one
in the car calls to a negro navvy on the line:
“Say, what’s the name of this town?” Negro:
“Illago, sa’.” Passenger: “How many people
live here?” Negro: “None at all, sa’.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Under the Palm-trees.</div>

<p class='c001'>Now we are practically out at sea, crossing
miles of blue water between the islands, sometimes
on limestone (or coral?) causeways,
sometimes on long bridges of wooden
trestles. At one point there lies,
about half a mile from the line, a little island,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>perhaps a mile long, entirely covered with palm-trees,
and with a single wooden house upon it—suggesting
an atoll of the Southern Seas.</p>

<p class='c001'>At a place called Long Key we stopped for
lunch. Long Key is a settlement of some twenty
one-storey wooden houses, all raised on piles about
four feet from the ground, and with every doorway
and window screened with wire gauze. The whole
place is embowered in palms; and under the
palms, twenty yards from the green sea, a wooden
counter had been set up, with the word “lunch,”
rudely painted on a shingle, displayed above it.
Two white women served behind the counter
and dispensed coffee (the milk poured through
a gimlet hole in a tin), sandwiches, coco-nut
milk, and little packages of coco-nut candy. I
had never before tasted coco-nut milk and am
not eager to quaff it again. It suggests nothing
so much as weak <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>eau sucrée</em></span>. The frugal meal,
in its romantic surroundings, was pleasant enough;
but I could wish that the wire-gauze screens had
been run round the lunch-counter. It was a
“quick lunch”—only fifteen minutes allowed—yet
when I returned to the train I found my neck
quite rough with mosquito-bites.</p>

<p class='c001'>From Long Key we presently ran out on an
immense viaduct, some two miles long, I should
say, of concrete arches. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Asia and Africa.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Then again
across jungle-covered islands and
some smaller lagoons. Here signs of life grew
more frequent, for we were approaching the point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>where the extension of the line is actively proceeding.
The labourers seem to be for the most
part accommodated in huge house-boats, which
we saw here and there moored in convenient
creeks and channels. The majority, I think, are
negroes, with a considerable intermixture of
“Dagos” and some East Indian coolies.</p>

<p class='c001'>At one point we passed a large truck crowded
with half-naked negro navvies, who swarmed over
it and clung on to it in every possible attitude,
grinning, joking, indulging in horse-play, so far
as their close quarters would allow—the very
picture, in short, of good-humoured, muscular
animalism. And in the middle of the swarm,
penned in on every side, and yet utterly aloof,
stood two turbaned Easterns; austere, unbending,
sombre, a trifle sinister. The negroes’ vivacity
and humour made them, in a way, more sympathetic,
but, at the same time, threw into relief
the distinction of the Orientals. They looked like
kings in exile among a rabble of savages. “Mere
Aryan prejudice,” you will say. Yes; but that
means that it is prehistoric and inveterate.</p>

<p class='c001'>Knight’s Key is but a temporary settlement
with a wharf, a railway yard, and one or two
warehouses. Thence the comfortable little steamship
Miami conveyed us in about five hours to
Key West, and in another seven or eight hours
to Havana—from the New World to the Old.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>II <br /> THE PROBLEM FACED</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Southern States of North America at present
offer to the world a spectacle unexampled in
history. It is the spectacle of two races, at the
opposite extremes of the colour scale, forced to
live together in numbers not very far from equal,
and on a theoretic basis of political equality. In
other regions where white men and black have
come into close contact, the circumstances have
been, and are, essentially different. In the greater
part of Africa the white man is a conquering
invader, living among blacks who are either
entirely savage, or obviously and confessedly but
little removed from savagery. No question of
“social equality” arises, and the question of
political rights, where it presents itself at all,
is uncomplicated by any predetermined constitutional
principle. In a large part of Spanish
America there has been so free an intermixture
of many races that it is practically impossible to
draw any colour line. Families of pure European
descent may hold themselves apart, but few of
these regions can by any strain of language be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>called “white men’s countries.”<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a> In the British
West Indies the whites are so small a percentage
of the population as to constitute a natural
aristocracy; and in most of the islands the two
races live peaceably under the slightly tempered
despotism of Crown Colony government. Moreover,
the white West Indian, even though he
may rarely cross the Atlantic, has always England
behind him. He is a member of a great white
community, which happens to control certain
tropical islands, mainly inhabited by blacks.
Here he may prefer to pitch his tent; but his
essential citizenship is still British. His social
and political relations with his black surroundings
are not to him a matter of life and death. Whatever
their local interest and importance, they do
not touch the fountain-head of his polity, the
homeland of his race.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is his only homeland that the Southern
American finds himself compelled to share, on
nominally equal terms, with a race which, whatever
its merits or demerits, its possibilities or its
impossibilities, stands at the extreme of physical
dissimilarity from his own. This is a condition
of life not easily understood by the European,
and not always very vividly realized even by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Northern American. I have devoted some effort
to realizing it, both by personal observation and
through the medium of books. The details of my
observations form the First Part of the present
volume. In this Second Part I propose to set
forth some of the large and essential facts of the
situation, as nearly as I can ascertain them, and
to state the general trend of the reflections these
facts have suggested to me.</p>

<h4 class='c020'><span class='sc'>Numbers and Vitality of the Negro</span></h4>

<p class='c011'>In the first place, what are the facts as to the
negro’s numbers, distribution, and rate of increase,
if any? They are not easy to ascertain: partly
because it is nine years since the last census
was taken (1900); partly because American vital
statistics are very scanty, and, where they can be
obtained at all, are apt to be untrustworthy.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would appear that, roughly speaking, one-third
of the population of the seventeen Southern
States is black or coloured. As against some
3 per cent. of negroes in the Northern and Western
States, there are about 33 per cent. in the South.
The total coloured population of the United States
is generally set down at about ten million, nine
million dwelling in the South and something over
one million in the North and West.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Now, are the negroes increasing? It used to
be thought that they were multiplying very rapidly.
Judge Tourgée, in 1884, prophesied that by 1900
they would outnumber the whites in every State
from Maryland to Texas. This prediction is far
from having fulfilled itself, and appears to have
been based on defective enumeration in the census
of 1870, which made the rate of negro increase
between 1870 and 1880 seem quite inordinate.
Now speculation has gone to the other extreme,
and prophesies the not very distant extinction of
the negro. This view is set forth with uncompromising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>emphasis by Mr. P. A. Bruce in
his “Rise of the New South” (Philadelphia,
1905):</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>The only cloud of any portentousness hanging over
the prospects of the Southern States is the continued
expansion of the black population.... The fact, however,
that the white inhabitants, as a body, are steadily outstripping
the black in numbers, is an indication that the
evils which are now created by the presence of so many
negroes in the South will not relatively and proportionately
grow more dangerous.... When the development of the
Southern States along its present lines has reached its last
stage, there is reason to think that an even greater relative
decline in the numerical strength of the black population
will set in. We have already pointed out the probable
effect of the subdivision of Southern lands, and the growth
of Southern towns, on the numerical expansion of the
negro race. As injurious to that race in the end as being
shut out of the general field of agriculture, or being
subjected to an abnormally high rate of mortality, will be
the relentless competition which is one of the conditions
of modern life in all civilized communities. The vaster
the growth of the Southern States in wealth and white
population, the sharper and more urgent will be the
struggle of the black man for existence. In order to hold
even his present position as a common labourer he will
have to exert himself to the utmost, and in doing so to
submit to a manner of life that will be even more
unwholesome and squalid than the one he now follows,
and sure to lead to a great increase in the already very
high rate of mortality for his race. The day will come in
the South, just as it came long ago in the North, when for
lack of skill, lack of sobriety, and lack of persistency, the
negro will find it more difficult to stand up as a rival to
the white working-man. Already it is the ultimate fate
of the negro that is in the balance, not the ultimate fate of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>the Southern States in consequence of the presence of the
negro. The darkest day for the Southern whites has
passed.... The darkest day for the Southern blacks has
only just begun.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>When I find this forecast cited with approval
by Dr. E. A. Alderman of the University of
Virginia, it acquires some authority in my eyes;
but still it seems far from convincing. It leaves
out of account one probability and one certainty.
The probability is that what may be called the
Hampton-Tuskegee movement—industrial education
and moral discipline—will in time so leaven
the mass of the negro race as to make it fitter to
compete with white labour, and abler to resist the
destructive influences on which Mr. Bruce dwells
with such gusto. I call this a probability, not a
certainty, for it is hard to tell as yet whether
the Hampton-Tuskegee spirit is really leavening
the mass, or only playing upon the surface. The
industrial college at Hampton is barely forty years
old; Mr. Booker Washington’s great institute at
Tuskegee came into being less than thirty years
ago; and the minor offshoots of the movement
are, of course, still younger. They have not had
time to give any just measure of their influence
in promoting the self-respect and the efficiency
of the negro race. But there is no doubt whatever
that they are doing a remarkable and
(from the negro point of view) a beneficent
work; the only doubt being as to whether the
work is or is not proceeding fast enough to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>overtake and counteract the forces that make for
degradation.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This, I say, is doubtful; but what is scarcely
doubtful is that the South, for its own sake,
cannot suffer Mr. Bruce’s prophecy to fulfil itself.
The gist of the forecast is, briefly, this: the rural
negro, who is admittedly prolific, and whose
children survive in fair proportions, will gradually
be driven into the towns, where all possible influences
are leagued against his moral and physical
well-being, and where the rate of negro mortality,
both infant and adult, is always very high and
often appalling. Thus, according to Mr. Bruce,
the “Afro-American” is being inexorably hounded
into the jaws of death, and must in due time
perish from off the face of the earth. But what is
to be the state of the South while this amiable
prophecy is working itself out? If the towns are
the jaws of death to the negro, what are they
to the white man and his children? Putting all
question of humanity aside, can any sane civic
policy permit negroes to crowd in their thousands
into city slums, and there to die like flies in conditions
“even more unwholesome and squalid”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>than those which at present obtain? Why is the
rate of negro mortality so high? Simply because
the black folk are less able than the whites to
resist the poisonous influences of bad sanitation,
moral as well as physical. But bad sanitation,
though it may be more fatal to one race than to
the other, inevitably takes its toll of both. Hear
what a Southern health officer has to say on this
point:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>We face the following issues: First: one set of people,
the Caucasian, with a normal death-rate of less than 16 per
thousand per annum, and right alongside of them is the
negro race, with a death-rate of 25 to 30 per thousand.
Second: the first-named race furnishing a normal, and the
second race an abnormal, percentage of criminals....
The negro is with you for all time. He is what you will
make him, and it is “up to” the white people to prevent
him from becoming a criminal, and to guard him against
tuberculosis, syphilis, etc. <em>If he is tainted with disease,
you will suffer: if he develops criminal tendencies, you will be
affected.</em></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>What can be more certain than this? And is
it to be conceived that the South will deliberately
refrain from looking to its physical and moral
sewerage until the negro shall have been killed
off?<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>It is not to be conceived, and it is not what is
happening. Better sanitary conditions are everywhere
being secured, though the movement is
slow in the cities of the South. In the North a
great improvement has already been effected. In
a report on “The Health and Physique of the
Negro American” (<cite>Atlanta University Publications</cite>,
No. XI., 1906) we read—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>Ten years ago the [negro] death-rate was twice the
birth-rate in New York; to-day they are about the same,
with the death-rate steadily decreasing and the birth-rate
increasing. Ten years ago the birth-rate of Philadelphia
was less than the death-rate; to-day it is six per thousand
higher.... With the improved sanitary condition, improved
education, and better economic opportunities, the
mortality of the race may, and probably will, steadily
decrease until it becomes normal.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>If there is any permanence and any efficacy in
the “wave of prohibition” that is passing over
the South, it must certainly cause a great reduction
in negro mortality; and it surely cannot be
long before means are found to check the vending
of noxious drugs. Unless, in short, the civilization
of the South is to stand still while the negro
dies off, there seems to be little likelihood of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>fulfilling Mr. Bruce’s prognostic. This great and
beautiful region cannot possibly find its salvation
in making itself a hell for the negro.</p>

<p class='c001'>When I quoted to Mr. Booker Washington Mr.
Bruce’s death-sentence on his people, he was
moved to one of his rare laughs. In Mr. Washington’s
opinion, which may very well prove to be
correct, the natural increase of the negro in the
South about keeps pace with that of the white
man. The white race, however, is being largely
recruited by immigration, so that its numerical
preponderance is doubtless increasing. It would
appear, then, that, unless conditions very greatly
alter, there is little chance of the black race out-breeding
and submerging the white, but equally
little chance of the black race being obliging
enough to die out. “Conservative” statisticians
estimate that at the close of this century there
will be anywhere from twenty-five to thirty-five
million negroes in America.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Taking the Southern States at large, then, we
find that one person out of every three is wholly
or partly of African blood. It is sometimes maintained
that really pure-bred negroes are very rare;
but this seems to be a mistake. Professor W. E. B.
Du Bois, himself a man of mixed origin and not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>likely to underestimate the number of his own
class, thinks that in two-thirds of the negroes of the
United States there are no “recognizable traces”
of white blood. He adds that white blood doubtless
exists in many who show no trace of it; but
for practical purposes this speculation may be disregarded.
I think we may take it as pretty
certain that if, in the South, one person out of
every three is of African descent, one person out
of every four is either actually or virtually a full-blooded
negro. But it must not be supposed that
the distribution of the races is by any means even.
Some districts, such as the mountainous regions of
Tennessee and West Virginia, contain hardly any
negroes; while in other districts, not a few, the
blacks largely outnumber the whites. These are,
no doubt, the districts in which the pure-bred
black most abounds.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Is there a “Negro Problem”?</span></p>

<p class='c001'>Having ascertained, approximately, the numerical
relations of the two races, we are now in a
position to consider the problem or problems
involved. And first we are confronted with the
question, “Is there any real problem at all?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Some people deny it, or at all events maintain
that the problem is created solely by the almost
insane arrogance and inhumanity of the Southern
white man. This view lingers in the North, among
the inheritors of the old abolitionist sentiment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>In England, it has been roundly expressed by
Mr. H. G. Wells, and somewhat more considerately
by even so high an authority as Sir Sydney
Olivier. I need scarcely say that it is a very
popular view among the negroes in the South
itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>For a typical (though moderate) American
utterance of this opinion the following may
suffice. It is a passage from “Race Questions
and Prejudices,” by a distinguished psychologist,
Professor Royce of Harvard (<cite>International Journal
of Ethics</cite>, April, 1906):</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>Scientifically viewed, these problems of ours turn out
to be not so much problems caused by anything which is
essential to the existence or to the nature of the races of
men themselves. Our so-called race problems are merely
the problems caused by our antipathies.... Such antipathies
will always play their part in human history.
But what we can do about them is to try not to be
fooled by them, not to take them too seriously, because
of their mere name. We can remember that they are
childish phenomena in our lives, phenomena on a level
with a dread of snakes or of mice, phenomena that we
share with the cats and with the dogs, not noble phenomena,
but caprices of our complex nature.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The attitude of the South, then, in the conception
of Professor Royce, is no more rational
than that of a woman who shrieks, jumps on a
chair, and gathers her skirts about her ankles,
because a mouse happens to run across the floor.
I should have thought that the wiser tendency of
modern science was to divine something more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>than a “caprice” in so deep-rooted an instinct
as the dread even of mice. As for the dread of
snakes, it was surely by a slip of the pen that
Professor Royce adduced it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not at all dissimilar is the judgment of Mr.
H. G. Wells. Hearing a great deal of loose,
illogical, inconclusive talk on the colour question,
and having himself taken a “mighty liking” to
these “gentle, human, dark-skinned people” as
he saw them in a Chicago music-hall and elsewhere,
Mr. Wells formed the opinion that there
was no reason at all in the Southern frame of
mind. His conclusion is that “these emotions
are a cult;” and by a cult he evidently means a
contagious, fanatical folly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, Mr. Wells is a man for whose essential
wisdom I have a very high respect. If I were
bound to acknowledge myself the disciple of any
living thinker, I should have small hesitation in
selecting him as my guide and philosopher. But
his chapter on “The Tragedy of Colour” in “The
Future in America” is tinged with what I cannot
but take to be a dogmatic impatience of all distinctions
and difficulties of race. Before writing
it, he might, I think, have asked himself whether
the theory of sheer race-monomania was not,
perhaps, a rather too simple way of accounting
for “emotions” felt with absolute unanimity (in
a greater or less degree) by some twenty million
Southern white people. The arguments he heard
might be weak, ill-informed, inconclusive; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>conduct in which the emotions expressed themselves
might often be indefensible and abhorrent;
and yet there might lie at the root of the emotions
something very different from sheer unreason. I
think Mr. Wells should have been chary of
“indicting a nation” without more careful reflection
and a closer scrutiny of evidence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sir Sydney Olivier, on the other hand, speaks
with the authority of one who has spent many
years in close contact with negroes, having been
a successful administrator of large communities
in which they greatly preponderate. It is impossible
to suspect him of hastiness or of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>à priori</em></span>
doctrinairism. What, then, is his view? In his
“White Capital and Coloured Labour” (1907), he
tells us that both in visiting the United States
and in discussing race questions with American
visitors to Jamaica, “he found himself, as a
British West Indian, unable to entirely account
for an attitude of mind which impressed him as
superstitious, if not hysterical, and as indicating
misapprehensions of premises very ominous for the
United States of the future.” He proceeds:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>The theory held in the Southern States of America
and in some British Colonies, comes, in substance, to
this—that the negro is an inferior order in nature to
the white man, in the same sense that the ape may be
said to be so. It is really upon this theory that American
negrophobia rests, and not only upon the viciousness or
criminality of the negro. This viciousness and criminality
are, in fact, largely invented, imputed, and exaggerated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>in order to support and justify the propaganda of race
exclusiveness (p. 43).</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>And again, in another part of his book:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>My argument has been that race prejudice is the
fetish of the man of short views; and that it is a short-sighted
and suicidal creed, with no healthy future for the
community that entertains it (p. 173).</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>I have very real diffidence in contesting the
deliberate judgment of a man like Sir Sydney
Olivier on a question which he has deeply
studied; but I cannot believe with him that
the problem is simply one of Southern unwisdom.
On the contrary, I believe that, however unwise
in much of her talk and her action, the South is
in the main animated by a just and far-feeling,
if not far-seeing, instinct. That there has been
an infinitude of tragic unwisdom in the matter,
not in the South alone, no one nowadays denies.
But I believe that the problem, far from being
unreal, is so real and so dishearteningly difficult
that nothing but an almost superhuman wisdom,
energy, and courage will ever effectually deal
with it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me try to give my reasons for this belief.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>White Man’s Land or Brown Man’s Land?</span></p>

<p class='c001'>No one, I suppose—not even Mr. Wells—would
deny that the importation of the African
into America was an egregious blunder as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>as a monstrous crime. Without him the South
would perhaps have developed more slowly during
the eighteenth century; but she would have
escaped the arrest of development which sums
up her history during the nineteenth century.
She would have escaped the war by which she
strove, with misguided heroism, to perpetuate
that arrest of development. She would have
escaped the “horrors” of that Reconstruction
period which still haunts her memory like a
nightmare. She would have escaped the prostration
and impoverishment from which she is only
now beginning—though very rapidly—to recover.
The negro has assuredly been her calamity in
the past. To say, as negro writers often do, that
he has created her wealth, is to ignore the appalling
price she has paid for him. Much more truly
may he be said to have created her poverty.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This, however, is certainly not the negro’s
fault. He did not thrust himself upon the South:
he was no willing immigrant. Historic recriminations,
therefore, are perfectly idle—as idle as the
attempts of Southern writers to shift responsibility
for the slave trade to the shoulders of the New
England States. I cast a glance back at history
merely to remind the reader that the presence
of the negro in America is not the result of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>natural movement, an inevitable expansion, a
migration springing from economic necessity or
from deep impulses of folk-psychology. It is,
on the contrary, the outcome of what may almost
be called a disastrous accident—of inhuman
cupidity in the slave-dealers and economic short-sightedness
in the slave-owners.</p>

<p class='c001'>The upshot, as we find it to-day, is that in
a magnificent country, well outside the torrid
zone, and eminently suited to be the home of a
white race, one person in every three is coloured,
and one person in every four is physically indistinguishable
from an African savage. It would
be the extravagance of paradox to maintain that
this is a positively desirable condition, preferable
to that of a country which presents a normal
uniformity of complexion. England, for instance,
would certainly not be a more desirable place of
residence if one-fourth of her population were
transmuted into the semblance of Dahomeyans,
even supposing that the metamorphosis involved
no moral or intellectual change for the worse. A
monochrome civilization is on the face of it preferable
to such a piebald civilization as at present
exists in the Southern States.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here at once, then, we have a difference
between the South and the West Indies, which Sir
Sydney Olivier seems strangely to overlook. The
West Indies are not climatically fitted to be a
“white man’s land”; or, if it was ever possible
that they should become one, the chance was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>lost at the very outset of their history. They
are once for all black men’s lands, with a sprinkling
of whites governing and exploiting them. It
would be much more reasonable for the black to
chafe under the dominance of the white, than
for the white to resent the presence of the black.
But the case in the Southern States is absolutely
different. They were explored, settled, organized
by white men; by white men their liberties were
vindicated. They are fitted by their climate and
resources to be not only a white man’s land, but
one of the greatest white men’s lands in the
world. The black man came there only as a
(terribly ill-chosen) tool for their development.
When the tool ceases to be a tool and claims a
third part of the heritage, the “peripeteia” is
no doubt dramatic and exceedingly moral, but
none the less exasperating to a generation which,
after all, was personally innocent of the original
crime-blunder. No one enjoys playing the scapegoat
in a moral apologue; and the Southern
white man would be more than human if he
accepted the part with perfect equanimity. At
any rate, the West Indian white man has no right
to assume an air of superior virtue until the conditions
of his case are even remotely analogous.
The negro in the West Indies is the essence and
foundation of life: in the United States he is
a regrettable accident.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span><span class='sc'>Four Possibilities: I. Extinction.</span></p>

<p class='c001'>It is time now that we should look more closely
into the conditions of this piebald community
which a violent interference with the normal
course of race-distribution has established in the
Southern States.</p>

<p class='c001'>The future seems to contain four possibilities,
or, rather, conceivabilities, which may be examined
in turn.</p>

<p class='c001'>(1) Things may “worry along” in the present
profoundly unsatisfactory condition, until the negro
gradually dies out.</p>

<p class='c001'>(2) The education of both races, and the moral
and economic elevation of the black race, may
gradually enable them to live side by side in
mutual tolerance and forbearance, without mingling,
but without clashing.</p>

<p class='c001'>(3) Marriage between persons of the two races
may—I mean might conceivably—be legalized,
and the colour-line obliterated by “miscegenation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(4)   The negro race might be geographically
segregated, by deportation or otherwise, and established
in a community or communities of
its own.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first eventuality—the evanescence of the
negro race—we have already examined and seen
to be highly improbable. Let me only add here
that there is one way in which it might conceivably
be brought about—a way too horrible to be
contemplated, yet not wholly beyond the bounds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>of possibility. The recurrence of such an outbreak
as the Atlanta riot of 1906 might lead to
very terrible consequences. On that occasion the
white mob found the negroes unarmed, and wreaked
its frenzy practically unopposed. But the lesson
was not lost on the negroes, and a similar onslaught
would, in many places, find them armed
and capable of a certain amount of resistance. In
that case one dares not think what might happen.
Their resistance could scarcely be effectual, in the
sense of intimidating and checking white violence.
It would, on the contrary, infuriate the mob, and
lend some show of justification to their proceedings;
while the frenzy would spread from city to
city, and the result might quite well be one of the
darkest pages in American or any other history.
Once let a dozen white men be killed by armed
negroes in any city of the South, and a flame
would burst out all over the land which would
work untold devastation before either authority
or humanity could check it. The incident would
be taken as a declaration of racial war; everywhere
the white mob would insist on searching
for arms in the negro quarters; the negroes would
inevitably attempt some panic-stricken defensive
organization; and the more effective it proved,
the more terrible would be the calamity to their
race. Not even in the wildest frenzy, of course,
could the race, or a tenth part of the race, be
violently wiped out; but they might be so dismayed
and terrorized as to lose that natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>buoyancy of spirit which has hitherto sustained
them, and enabled them to increase and multiply.
The prophets of extinction already read hopelessness
and a prescience of doom in the negro tone
of mind; but, so far, I think the wish is father
to the thought. The race, as a whole, is confident,
in its happy-go-lucky way. But would
their spirit survive a great massacre, followed by
an open and chronic <em>Negerhetze</em>? I doubt it; and
I believe it possible that in this way Mr. P. A.
Bruce’s prophecy might be realized more rapidly
than he anticipated.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be an exaggeration to say that the
South lives on the brink of such a horror; but
there is no denying that the elements are present
which might one day bring it to pass.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a> Sir Sydney
Olivier is quite right in calling the feeling of a
large class of Southerners towards the negro
“hysterical” and ungoverned; and this is just
the class that is handiest with its “guns.” Long
and laborious treatises have been written to prove,
on Biblical evidence, that the negro is a “beast,”
and, on scientific evidence, that he is more nearly
an ape than a man. These works, no doubt, are
scarcely sane; but their insanity is by no means
peculiar to their individual authors. The word
“extermination” is gravely spoken by men who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>are not therefore held to be maniacs or even monomaniacs.
The South, says Mr. W. E. B. Du Bois,
is “simply an armed camp for intimidating black
folk”; and where such a condition prevails, the
possibility of sudden disaster is never far off. To
recognize the possibility is not to bring it nearer,
but rather to indicate the urgent need of measures
that shall place it infinitely remote.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><span class='sc'>Four Possibilities: II. The Atlanta Compromise.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>We pass now to the second eventuality—the
gradual smoothing away of friction, so that the
two races may live side by side, never blending
and yet never jarring. This is the conception
set forth in Mr. Booker Washington’s celebrated
“Atlanta Compromise” speech of 1895, wherein
he said, “In all things purely social we can be as
separate as the five fingers, and yet one as the
hand in all things essential to mutual progress.”
Is this a possible—I will not say ideal, for that
it manifestly is not—but a possible working
arrangement?</p>

<p class='c001'>One thing is evident at the outset—namely,
that the fourteen years that have elapsed since
Mr. Washington uttered this aspiration have
brought its fulfilment no nearer. Both negro
education and white education have advanced in
the interim; the “respectable” and well-to-do
class of negroes has considerably increased; but
the feeling between the races is worse rather than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>better. Mr. Thomas Nelson Page used to say,
“Northerners espouse the cause of the negro as
a race, but dislike negroes individually; while
Southerners do not dislike negroes individually,
but oppose them as a race.”<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a> Ten years ago
there was a large element of truth in this saying;
but it becomes less and less true with every year
that passes. The old-time kindliness of feeling
between the ex-owner and the ex-slave is rapidly
becoming a mere tradition. No common memories
or sentiments hold together the new generations
of the two races; they are growing up in unmitigated
mutual antipathy. At best, indeed, the
Southern kindliness of feeling towards the individual
negro subsisted only so long as he “knew
his place” and kept it; and the very process of
education and elevation on which Mr. Washington
relies renders the negro ever less willing to keep
the place the Southern white man assigns him.
In the North, too, while the dislike of the individual
has greatly increased, the theoretic fondness
for the race has very perceptibly cooled. Altogether,
the tendency of events since 1895 has not
been at all in the direction of the Atlanta Compromise.
The Atlanta riot of eleven years later
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>was a grimly ironic comment on Mr. Washington’s
speech.</p>

<p class='c001'>This merely means, it may be said, that
education has as yet produced no sensible effect
upon the inveterate and inhuman prejudice of the
South. Nevertheless, time and patience may
justify Mr. Washington’s optimism. There is no
saying, indeed, what a great deal of time and a
great deal of patience may not effect. Meanwhile,
let us see what is really involved in the
idea of the Atlanta Compromise.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are to conceive, in the first place, an
immense advance in the negro race—an advance
in education, industry, thrift, and general efficiency.
Well, this is possible enough—the negro is certainly
civilizable, if not indefinitely, at any rate
far beyond the average level he has yet attained.
Negro crime might easily be reduced within
normal limits; for the race is not inherently
criminal, but is rendered so by ignorance, poverty,
vice, injustice, and a thoroughly bad penal system.
The next fifty years, if present influences continue
to work unimpeded, may see a very large increase
in the class of law-abiding, property-holding
negroes, and possibly a considerable improvement
even in the condition of the black proletariat.
But supposing that, by the exercise of infinite
patience for fifty or a hundred years, a condition
something like that indicated in the Atlanta
formula were ultimately attained, would it be
desirable? and could it be permanent?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>The assumed improvement of conditions would,
of course, imply a steady increase in the numbers
of the black race; so that, even with the aid of
immigration, the white race would probably not
greatly add to its numerical superiority. Let us
suppose that at the end of fifty years the coloured
people were not as one in three, but as one in
four, and that this ratio remained pretty constant.
Here, then, we should have a nation within a
nation, unassimilated and (by hypothesis) unassimilable,
occupying one-fourth of the whole field
of existence, and performing no function that
could not, in their absence, be at least as well
performed by assimilable people, whose presence
would be a strength to the community.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a> The
black nation would be a hampering, extraneous
element in the body politic, like a bullet encysted
in the human frame. It may lie there for years
without setting up inflammation or gangrene, and
causing no more than occasional twinges of pain;
but it certainly cannot contribute to the health,
efficiency, or comfort of the organism. Is it
wonderful that the Atlanta Compromise, supposing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>it realized in all conceivable perfection, should
excite little enthusiasm in the white South?</p>

<p class='c001'>But to imagine it realized in perfection is to
imagine an impossibility—almost a contradiction
in terms. We are, on the one hand, to suppose the
negro ambitious, progressive, prosperous, and, on
the other hand, to imagine him humbly acquiescent
in his status as a social pariah. The thing is out
of the question; such saintlike humility has long
ceased to form any part of the moral equipment of
the American negro. The bullet could never be
thoroughly encysted; it would always irritate,
rankle, fester. Mr. Washington’s formula in renouncing
social equality is judiciously vague as to
political rights. But one thing is certain—neither
Mr. Washington nor any other negro leader really
contemplates their surrender. It is quite inconceivable
that the nation within a nation should
acquiesce in disfranchisement; and the question
of the negro vote will always be a disturbing
factor in Southern political life. Either he must
be jockeyed out of it by devices abhorrent to
democratic principle and more or less subversive
of political morality; or, if he be honestly suffered
to cast his ballot, he will block the healthy
divergence of political opinion in the South, since,
in any party conflict, he would hold the balance
between the two sides, and thus become the
dominant power in the State. This will always be
a danger so long as the unassimilated negro is
forced, by his separateness, to think and act first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>as a negro and only in the second place as an
American. Even if the Atlanta Compromise were
otherwise realizable, the friction at this point
would always continue acute.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><span class='sc'>The Crux of the Problem.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The worst, however, remains behind. If the
Atlanta Compromise were possible in every other
way, it would be impossible on the side of sex. For
two races to dwell side by side in large numbers,
and to be prohibited from coming together in legal
marriage, is unwholesome and demoralizing to
both. I am not thinking mainly of what Mr. Ray
Stannard Baker calls “the tragedy of the mulatto.”
It seems hard, no doubt, that marriage should be
impossible between a white man and a girl in
whose complexion, perhaps, an eighth or sixteenth
part of negro blood is entirely imperceptible; but
such cases are romantic exceptions, and do not
constitute a serious factor in the problem.
Negroes, at any rate, will tell you proudly that
the young men and women of their race, however
light-skinned, hold it no hardship that their choice
of mates should be restricted to their own people.
Whatever be the truth as to these marginal relations,
they are not the essence of the matter.
The essence is simply this: the youth and manhood
of the white South is subjected to an
altogether unfair and unwholesome ordeal by the
constant presence of a multitude of physically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>well-developed women, among whom, in the lower
levels, there is no strong tradition of chastity, and
to whom the penalties of incontinence are very
slight. To say, as many Southerners will, that
there is no such thing as virtue among negro
women is stupidly libellous; but it is impossible
to doubt that the average standard of sexual conduct
among the lower orders of the black and
brown population is anything but high. And this
is not a state of things that can be radically
amended in one generation or in two. The completest
realization of the Atlanta Compromise that
is conceivable within, say, a century, would still
leave the white male exposed, from boyhood
upward, to a stimulation of his animal instincts
which, in the peculiar circumstances of the case,
cannot be otherwise than unwholesome.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are here at the very heart of the problem.
All other relations are adjustable, at a certain
sacrifice; but not this one. If the two races are
to live together without open and lawful intermingling,
it must be at the cost of incessant
demoralization to both. “Miscegenation,” in the
sense of permanent concubinage and the rearing
of hybrid families, may be held in check by the
strong social sentiment against it,<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a> but nothing
can hold in check the still more degrading casual
commerce between the white man (and youth)
and the coloured woman. It is probably this fact,
quite as much as the hideous proclivities of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>criminal negro male, that hardens the heart of
the white woman against the black race. Nor is
the unwholesomeness of the condition measured
by the actual amount of laxity to which it leads.
Temptation may in myriads of cases be resisted;
but this order of temptation ought not to be in
the air.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a> It cannot be good for any race of men
to be surrounded by strongly-accentuated Sex,
which, for ulterior reasons, whereof the mere
animal nature takes little account, is placed under
a tabu.</p>

<p class='c001'>I venture to say that no one—not even Mr.
Washington himself—really believes in the Atlanta
Compromise as a stable solution of the problem.
The negroes who accept it as an interim ideal (so
to speak), never doubt that it is but a stepping-stone
to freedom of racial intermixture. They see
that so long as constant physical propinquity
endures, the colour barrier between the sexes is
factitious, and in great measure unreal, and they
believe that at last the race-pride of the white
man will be worn down, and he will accept the
inevitable amalgamation.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c013'><sup>[58]</sup></a> The ultimate forces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>at war in the South are the instinctive, half-conscious
desire of the black race to engraft itself on
the white stock,<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c013'><sup>[59]</sup></a> and the no less instinctive
horror of the white stock at such a surrender of
its racial integrity. This horror is all the more
acute—all the more morbid, if you will—because
the white race is conscious of its own frailty, and
knows that it is, in some sense, fighting a battle
against perfidious nature. It is a hard thing to
say, but I have little doubt it is true, that much
of the injustice and cruelty to which the negro is
subjected in the South is a revenge, not so much
for sexual crime on the negro’s part, as for an
uneasy conscience or consciousness on the part
of the whites.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c013'><sup>[60]</sup></a> It is because the black race
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>inevitably appeals to one order of low instincts
in the white, that it suffers from the sympathetic
stimulation of another order of low instincts.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><span class='sc'>Four Possibilities: III. Amalgamation.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>This brings us, of course, to the third of the
conceivabilities above enumerated—the legalization
of marriage between the two races. To the
white South, nothing is more inconceivable: to
the critics of the white South, nothing is more
simple. Which of them is in the right?</p>

<p class='c001'>It is significant that none of these outside
critics puts the slightest faith in the Atlanta
Compromise. They see quite clearly that the
two races cannot live together and yet apart.
Their solution is the obvious one of free intermixture,
and they cannot understand why the
South should be so inveterately opposed to it.
Why make such a fuss, they say, over such a
simple matter?</p>

<p class='c001'>And then comes a long array of arguments to
minimize, in general, the significance of race, and,
in particular, the gap between the white race and
the black. Racial purity is a vain imagination;
there is no such thing, at any rate among
European peoples; and if it existed it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>only be a limitation and a misfortune to the
people afflicted with it. Most of all is the
Anglo-Saxon race ridiculed as a historic fallacy.
The South, which boasts itself almost the last
stronghold of pure Anglo-Saxondom,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c013'><sup>[61]</sup></a> is told that
the pure Anglo-Saxon is a myth and a superstition.
As to the negro, we are assured that
we were all negroes once, or something very
much to that effect. At any rate, it is asserted
that the Mediterranean races, with whom Western
civilization originated, were in great part of negro
origin. Skull-measurement and brain-weight are
called in to prove—whatever the particular disputant
wants to prove. Special qualities are
claimed for the negro—such as a rich imagination,
an innate courtesy, and a strong musical
faculty; and it is argued that these are the very
things of which the (so-called) Anglo-Saxon race
stands most in need. Great play is made with
the quasi-scientific modern Rousseauism which
avers that our barbarian ancestors were better
men than we, and thence argues that there is
little or no real gap between the savage of to-day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>and the civilized man. Weismannism is pressed
into the service to show that, as the aptitudes
and tendencies that we sum up in the word
civilization are acquired and therefore (it is
argued) untransmissible, the white child can
have profited nothing by its ancestors’ centuries
of upward struggle from barbarism, while the
black child cannot be in any way handicapped
by his descent through untold ages of savagery.
We are even assured that civilization has sprung
from and must be maintained by “the commingling
of all with all, the general ‘panmixture,’
the universal ‘half-breed.’”<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c013'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Fortunately it is quite unnecessary that I
should plunge into the mazes of ethnological
controversy. It is sufficient for my present
purpose to note that controversy, and very
lively controversy, exists. The practical equality
of the two races is so far from being a point on
which all authorities are agreed, that it may
rather be called a paradox which charms a certain
order of mind by reason of its very audacity. So,
too, with the opinion that, whether the African
race be or be not inferior, it possesses qualities
that the European stock needs, and ought to
accept with gratitude. Whether true or false,
this is, at present at any rate, a quite undemonstrated
speculation. Even Sir Sydney Olivier,
who maintains in general that a man of mixed
race is “potentially a more competent vehicle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>humanity,” advances no proof of the benefits of
the particular mixture in question which can for
a moment be expected to carry conviction to the
Southern white man. The South, then, is urged
by the amalgamation theorists to embark upon,
or submit to, what is at best a great experiment.
It is to quell its higher instincts (for so it regards
them, rightly or wrongly) and commit what it feels
in the marrow of its bones to be a degrading race-abnegation,
in deference to a half-scientific, half-humanitarian
opinion, held by certain theorists
outside its own boundaries, to the effect that,
after all, there is no great difference between black
and white, and that the complexion of the future
will certainly be a uniform yellow. Can any one
blame the South for answering: “No, thank you!
If you in England or in New England are tired of
being white men, and sigh for the blessings of an
African blend, we can send you several million
negroes, of both sexes, who will no doubt be
happy, on suitable terms, to intermarry with your
sons and daughters. For our part, we are content
with our complexion as it is. We see no reason
to believe that the African slave trade was the
means adopted by a beneficent Providence for the
ultimate improvement of our Anglo-Saxon stock;
nor, on the other hand, can we accept it as a just
punishment for the sins of our fathers that our
race, as a race, should be merged and obliterated
in indiscriminate hybridism.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I do not pretend, of course, that the fixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>antipathy of the South to the very idea of amalgamation
is a purely rational one. Who is so foolish
as to look for pure reason in aught that concerns
the obscure fundamentals of life? What I am
trying to show is that, whatever irrational elements
may mingle with it, the Southern sentiment has
a solid and sufficient nucleus of reason. The
advantages of fusion, as between such antipodal
races as the white European and the black
African, are, to say the least of it, unproved;
and a race may be forgiven, surely, which declines
to try on its own body, so to speak, so problematic
and so irremediable an experiment. For, once
made, this experiment cannot be unmade. The
South must choose between definitely renouncing
its position as a “white man’s land” or struggling
to maintain it. What wonder if it feels that it
has no choice in the matter?</p>

<h3 class='c021'><span class='sc'>The Races not Equal.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>I have stated the case at the very lowest in
saying that the advantages of fusion are unproved.
Though it is not essential to my position, I must
confess that my personal belief goes much further,
and that the disadvantages of fusion are, to my
thinking, proved beyond all reasonable doubt. I
have not hitherto emphasized the essential and
innate inferiority of the negro race, because my
argument did not demand it. But the fact of this
inferiority seems to me as evident as it is inevitable.
However fallacious may be the boundaries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>between this and that European race, the boundary
between the European and the African is real, and
not to be argued away. The European is the fruit
of untold generations of upward struggle, the
African of untold generations of immobility. At
the very dawn of history, the ancestors of the
white American had advanced to a point beyond
that which the ancestors of the Afro-American had
attained when they were shipped across the
Atlantic from fifty to two hundred years ago.
That the negro race has some very amiable
qualities is not denied. It is not denied that
civilization has brought with it certain disadvantages
and corruptions, and that the white
savage is in some ways a more deplorable phenomenon
than the black savage. Nor is it denied
that the negro, in virtue of his strong imitative
instinct, has, in many cases, shown a remarkable
power of taking on a certain measure of civilization.
But all this does not practically lessen the
huge historic gap between the two races. Even if
we admit the innate power of the negro to overtake
the white man in intellectual grasp and moral
stability, we must in reason allow him a few
centuries to make up his millenniums of arrearage.
Whatever it may become in the course of ten or
fifteen generations, the negro race here and now
is inferior to the white race, not only because of
its “previous condition of servitude,” but, ultimately
and fundamentally, because of its recent
condition of savagery. Therefore, the white race,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>in accepting amalgamation, would be derogating
from its birthright and climbing down the scale of
humanity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our theorists are, on the whole, too much
inclined to confound instinct with prejudice. It is
absurd to class as pure prejudice the white man’s
preference for the colour and facial contour of his
race. This is no place for an analysis of our sense
of beauty; but to maintain offhand that it is an unmeaning
product of sheer habit, with no biological
justification, is simply to shirk the problem and
postpone analysis to dogma. Does any one really
believe that the genius of Cæsar and Napoleon, of
Milton and Goethe, had nothing to do with their
facial angle, and could have found an equally convenient
habitation behind thick lips and under
woolly skulls? The negro himself (as distinct from
the mulatto rhetorician) takes his stand on no such
paradox. Whoever may doubt the superiority of
the white race, it is not he; and it is a racial, not
merely a social or economic superiority to which
he does instinctive homage. It does not enter his
head to champion his own racial ideal, to set up
an African Venus in rivalry to the Hellenic, and
claim a new Judgment of Paris between them. If
wishing could change the Ethiopian’s skin there
would be never a negro in America.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c013'><sup>[63]</sup></a> The black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>race, out of its poverty, spends thousands of
dollars annually on “anti-kink” lotions, vainly
supposed to straighten the African wool.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c013'><sup>[64]</sup></a> The
brown belle tones her complexion with pearl
powder; and many a black mother takes pride in
the brown skin of her offspring, though it proclaims
their illegitimacy. There can be no reasonable
doubt that amalgamation, in the negro’s
eyes, means an enormous gain to his race. It
means ennoblement, transfiguration. It is quite
natural that he should not too curiously inquire
whether the gain to him would involve a corresponding
loss to the white man. That is the
white man’s business, not his. The one thing his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>instinct tells him is that, if he can break down the
white man’s resistance and make the Southern
States a brown or yellow man’s land, he will have
achieved a splendid racial triumph.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><span class='sc'>The Case for the Mulatto.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>It is urged, as we have already seen, that the
black man’s gain would not be the white man’s loss,
but that the black race would bring to the white
certain qualities of which it stands sorely in need,
the result of the mixture being a more competent
“vehicle of all the qualities and powers that we
imply by humanity.” Has experience justified
this speculation? We have ample experience to
go upon—in South America, in the West Indies,
in the Southern States themselves. The mulatto
exists and has existed for generations, not in
hundreds or thousands, but in millions; in what
respect has he proved himself superior to the pure
Spaniard, or Portuguese, or Anglo-Saxon? Does
South American history bear testimony to his
political competence? Have his achievements in
science, in art, in literature, in music, been
superior to those of the un-Africanized peoples?
Or, waiving the question of superiority, has he
even, in these domains, produced meritorious work
in any fair proportion to his numbers? I do not
say that it is impossible to make a sort of case for
him, by the ransacking of records and the employment
of a very indefinite standard of values. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>I do most emphatically say that no conspicuous
and undeniable advantage has resulted from the
blending of bloods, such as can or ought to
counteract the instinctive repugnance of the
South.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a work entitled “Twentieth Century Negro
Literature,”<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c013'><sup>[65]</sup></a> published in 1901, Mr. Edward E.
Cooper, a mulatto journalist, quotes Byron’s
lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You have the letters Cadmus gave;</div>
      <div class='line'>Think ye he meant them for a slave?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>and then comments as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>Now Cadmus was a black African slave, captured in
war; so was Æsop, the world’s greatest fabulist; so was
Terence, among the grandest of Rome’s lyric poets; so
was Pushkin, the national poet to-day of Russia; so was
Alexandre Dumas, the first, the greatest, not only of French
novelists, but of novelists of all times, and the infinite
storehouse from which all novelists draw, Honoré de Balzac
and Charles Dickens to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>This writer can scarcely mean what he says—namely,
that Alexandre Dumas and the rest were
all black African slaves captured in war. We
must interpret him liberally, and take him to be
simply asserting the literary genius of the African
race, whether pure or blended. A better case
than this might doubtless be made for it; but
a ten times better case would still be very far
from a good case. And Mr. Edward E. Cooper is
a fair average specimen of the negro champion of
negro genius. Another spokesman of the race,
by the way, in the same collection of essays,
argues that if the Southern clergy had done their
duty in denouncing lynching, there would have
been no assassination of President McKinley,
“nor would there be anywhere such an illiberal
public sentiment as would openly criticize our
Chief Executive for dining a representative member
of the race whose feasts even Jupiter did not
disdain to grace.”<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c013'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c021'><span class='sc'>A Biological Argument.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>To wind up this attempt to place on a basis
of reason the Southern horror of amalgamation,
I return for a moment to Sir Sydney Olivier’s
argument on the point.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c013'><sup>[67]</sup></a> He says:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>There may naturally be aversion on the part of and a
strong social objection on behalf of the white woman against
her marriage with a black or coloured man. There is no
correspondingly strong instinctive aversion, nor is there so
strong an ostensible social objection to a white man’s
marrying a woman of mixed descent. The latter kind of
union is much more likely to occur than the former. There
is good biological reason for this distinction. Whatever
the potentialities of the African stocks as a vehicle for
human manifestation, and I myself believe them to be exceedingly
important and valuable, ... the white races
are now, in fact, by far the farther advanced in effectual
human development, and it would be expedient on this
account alone that their maternity should be economized
to the utmost. A woman may be the mother of a limited
number of children, and our notion of the number advisable
is contracting: it is bad natural economy, and instinct
very potently opposes it, to breed backwards from her.
There is no such reason against the begetting of children
by white men in countries where, if they are to breed at
all, it must be with women of coloured or mixed races.
The offspring of such breeding, whether legitimate or
illegitimate, is, from the point of view of efficiency, an
acquisition to the community, and under favourable conditions,
an advance on the pure-bred African.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>To this I have nothing to object, save that
it manifestly and in its very terms does not apply
to the Southern States of America. Sir Sydney
does not intend it so to apply; but when he
proceeds to speak of the Southern States, he
somehow neglects to draw the necessary distinctions.
The conditions he has in mind in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>above paragraph are those of a black man’s land,
not of a white man’s land. It may readily be
granted that a fundamentally black community
gains by the infusion of white blood, though the
circumstances of the “first cross” are scarcely
agreeable to civilized sentiment. There can be
little beyond sheer animalism in the relations
between a white man and a black woman; and
such parentage cannot be reckoned the most
desirable. This feeling, however, is perhaps a
mere superstition; the science of eugenics is not
yet far enough advanced, I take it, to afford us
any authoritative guidance. Sir Sydney Olivier,
at all events, rejects without hesitation the view
that the mulatto is inferior, not only to the white,
but to the pure black. The mulatto element in
a black community, he maintains, is a distinct
gain; and the larger it is the better. So far, I
am quite willing to follow him; but surely the
same process of reasoning, applied to a white
community, must lead to exactly the opposite conclusion.
It is this fundamental distinction between
a black and white community that Sir Sidney
either ignores, or declines to take into account.
The South is obviously not a country where, “if
white men are to breed at all, it must be with
women of coloured races.” It is a country where
a pure white race increases rapidly in spite of the
disturbance (economic and sexual) undoubtedly
set up by the constant propinquity of a black
race. In bygone days, when the black race
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>was a herd of human chattels, with no political
or social rights, a great deal of intermixture
took place. It was, as Sir Sydney would
doubtless admit, morally bestial and degrading;
but on the principles he lays down, and on the
assumption that slavery was part of the eternal
scheme of things, it was probably good policy,
inasmuch as it improved the breed of the black
community—the community of slaves.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c013'><sup>[68]</sup></a> But
when the black community ceased to be, in its
very nature, a thing apart—when its members
became freemen and citizens, indistinguishable,
in constitutional theory, from members of the
white community—then the conditions entirely
altered. It was one thing to produce a superior
breed of slaves; it is quite another to go on
producing an inferior breed of citizens, and to
legalize the production of such a breed. “But
I deny the inferiority!” Sir Sydney may say. “I
contend that the good qualities of the white race
are preserved, and are reinforced by the addition
of certain very valuable qualities which are the
special endowment of the black race.” It is not
very easy to see why, if this argument hold good,
Sir Sydney should discountenance the mating of
the black man with the white woman. Either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>the African strain is valuable or it is not; if it is,
why should there be any “bad natural economy”
in such unions? Waiving this point, however,
I think we have already seen pretty clearly why
Sir Sydney’s argument meets with scant acceptance
in the South. The plain reason is that it
opposes to a deep-rooted instinct a wholly unproved
speculation. The South has not discovered,
in its own pretty considerable experience, the
advantages of hybridism as compared with purity
of white blood; nor does Sir Sydney himself
advance anything that can possibly be called
proof of his opinion. A white nation can scarcely
be expected to renounce its racial integrity on
the chance of breeding an occasional Alexandre
Dumas.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sir Sydney Olivier’s biological principle, strictly
and consistently applied, would issue in a law
making marriage legal between any male and a
female lower in the colour scale than himself,
but illegal between any female and a male with
a larger proportion of African blood. Such a
law would, of course, be absolutely impossible
of enforcement; and equally inconceivable in
practice would be any other partial and restricted
legalization of inter-racial unions. There is no
middle course between a resolute maintenance
of the legal barrier between the races and a
complete acceptance of the principle of amalgamation.
If the legal barrier were ever removed, it
would mean such a relaxation of public sentiment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>as would insure the very rapid increase of the
hybrid race.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c013'><sup>[69]</sup></a> Three or four generations would
see the South a brown man’s land, with, no
doubt, a rapidly narrowing white aristocracy. In
another three or four generations the prevailing
complexion of the North would be sensibly
affected; and, finally, the whole American nation
would be typically negroid, the pure white man
being the more or less rare exception. For my
part, I cannot but sympathize with the sentiment
that violently repudiates such a contingency. I
do not understand how any white man who has
ever visited the South can fail to be dismayed
at the thought of absorbing into the veins of his
race the blood of the African myriads who swarm
on every hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the South itself, at any rate, the discussion
is purely academic. Amalgamation is a thousand
leagues remote from the sphere of practical
politics. I have been endeavouring to state for
outsiders the case of the South as I understand it.
I may have stated it wrongly, or understated it;
but no one can possibly overstate the resolve of
the South that the colour line shall not be
obliterated by “miscegenation.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>
  <h3 class='c021'><span class='sc'>Four Possibilities: IV. Segregation.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Lastly, we have to consider the fourth conceivable
eventuality—the geographical segregation of
the negro race, whether within or without the
limits of the United States.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is usually ridiculed as an absolutely
Utopian scheme, and at the outset of my investigation
I myself regarded it in that light. But
the more I saw and read and thought, the oftener
and the more urgently did segregation recur to
me as the one possible way of escape from an
otherwise intolerable situation. Not, of course,
the instant, and wholesale, and violent deportation
of ten million people—that is a rank impossibility.
Between that and inert acquiescence in the
ubiquity of the negro throughout the Southern
States, there are many middle courses; and I
cannot but believe that the first really great
statesman who arises in America will prove his
greatness by grappling with this vast but not
insoluble problem. And, assuredly, the sooner he
comes the better.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen that the negro race is not dying
out, or that, if it does die out, it can only be, so
to speak, at the cost of Southern civilization—through
the indefinite continuance of insanitary
and barbarous conditions. We have seen that
the Atlanta Compromise is illusory and impracticable,
that there is no reasonable hope that the
two races will ever live together, yet apart—in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>economic solidarity, yet without social or sexual
contact. We have seen that the essence of the
whole situation lies in the negro’s inevitable
ambition (even though it be unformulated and
largely unconscious) to be drawn upward, through
physical coalescence, into the white race, and the
white man’s intense resolve that, on a large and
determining scale, no such coalescence shall take
place. Now this state of war—for such it undoubtedly
is—will not correct itself by lapse of
time. It will continue to degrade and demoralize
both races until active measures are taken to put
an end to it. Though I sympathize with the
white man’s horror of amalgamation, I neither
approve nor extenuate the systematic injustice
and frequent barbarity in which that horror
expresses itself. The present state of society in
the South is as inhuman as it is inconsistent with
the democratic and Christian principles which the
Southern white man so loudly, and in the main
sincerely, professes. The Jim Crow car, and all
such discriminations in the system of public conveyance,
are, I believe, necessities, but deplorable
necessities none the less. The constant struggle
to exclude the negro from political power is at
best a negative and unproductive expenditure of
energy, at worst a source of political dishonesty
and corruption. The wresting of the law, whether
criminal or civil, into an instrument for keeping
the negro in a state of abject serfdom, is a scandal
and a disgrace to any civilized community. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>constant resort to lawless violence and cruelty in
revenge for negro crime (real or imaginary) is a
hideous blot upon the fair fame of the South, if
not rather an impeachment of her sanity. The
truth is, in fact, that constant inter-racial irritation
leaves neither race entirely sane, and that abominable
crime and no less abominable punishment are
merely the acutest symptom of an ill-omened
conjuncture of things, which puts an unfair and
unnatural strain upon both black and white human
nature. The criminal stupidity that brought the
negro to America cannot be annulled by passively
“making the best of it.” If its evil effects are to
be counteracted, corrected, and wiped out, it must
be through an active and constructive effort of
large-minded statesmanship.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><span class='sc'>Back to Africa?</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The deportation of the negro has been urged
by many American writers, generally in a somewhat
illogical fashion. They start by asserting his
total incapacity for self-government, as demonstrated
in Haiti, Liberia, and elsewhere, and then
recommend the foundation of a new negro republic
in some undefined portion of Africa. A curious
scheme was put forward in 1889, in an anonymous
book entitled, “An Appeal to Pharaoh,” written,
I believe, by Mr. Carl McKinley, of Charleston,
South Carolina. Mr. McKinley’s proposal was to
promote “the voluntary and steady emigration of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>the active maternal element of the negro
race.” He calculated that if 12,500 child-bearing
females, between the ages of twenty and
thirty, could every year be induced to emigrate
(taking their husbands with them), the whole
“maternal element” of the coloured population
would be removed within fifty years. The plan
was, apparently, that as soon as a child was born
to a young negro couple, they were to be persuaded
to emigrate, and that thus the prolific
negro would gradually be transferred to the new
negro commonwealth, only the sterile element of
the race being left to die off at their leisure. It is
unnecessary to criticize this scheme, which is now
twenty years old, and does not seem to have found
any serious champions. I mention it as perhaps
the most carefully considered of the suggestions
for an exodus to Africa.</p>

<p class='c001'>In no form does the African project seem to
me at all a hopeful one. The habitable portions
of Africa are, I take it, pretty well staked out
among the European Powers, so that an elaborate
and costly international arrangement would be
necessary before the requisite territory would be
available. But supposing this difficulty overcome,
would the United States be justified in simply
dumping its coloured population in Africa, and
then washing its hands of them? It might just
as well drive them into the sea and have done
with it. The negro character has shown no
fitness for the very difficult task of combined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>pioneering and nation-building that it would have
to encounter. To the lower elements in the race,
the return to Africa might mean repatriation in
the sense of a not unwelcome home-coming to
savagery; but the better elements would suffer
greatly in such a relapse, while of their own
strength they probably could not resist it. Toward
these better elements, and indeed toward
the whole race, the United States has a responsibility
that it could not, and certainly would not,
shirk; so that it would in effect have to undertake
the policing of a distant, troublesome, and
unsatisfactory dependency, which might, in addition,
not improbably involve it in international
difficulties. This would be preferable to the
present state of things, but still far from a
desirable solution of the problem.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same objections apply to a settlement in
South America, the Philippines, or anywhere else
outside the United States. Deportation, in a
word, is beset with disadvantages. It would be
ruinously costly and indefensibly cruel. If there
ever was a time for it, that time is past.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><span class='sc'>A Negro State.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>What, then, is the alternative? Manifestly,
concentration within the United States—the formation
of a new State which should be, not a
white man’s land, but a black man’s land.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is this physically possible? Is there enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>unoccupied territory to permit of such a concentration?
Of absolutely unoccupied territory
there probably is not enough; but those who
have studied the matter tell us that there is
plenty of territory so thinly occupied that the
white settlers could be removed and compensated
at no extravagant cost. According to the Honourable
John Temple Graves:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>Lower California might be secured. The lands west of
Texas may be had. But the Government does not need to
purchase. Four hundred million acres of Government land
is yet untaken and undeveloped in the West. Of these
vast acres the expert hydrographer of the Interior Department
has reported that it is easily possible to redeem by
irrigation enough to support in plenty a population of
sixty million people.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>We may liberally discount this estimate, and
yet leave it unquestionable that the resources of
the United States are amply sufficient to admit of
the establishment of a new State without any
exorbitant disturbance of the existing distribution
of territory.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be absurd for me to forecast in any
detail the methods by which the concentration
should be brought about. They must be devised
and elaborated by the great American statesman
who is to come. If he can successfully grapple
with this colossal task, he will deserve to rank
with Washington and Lincoln in the affections
of his countrymen. It may be pretty safely predicted
that he will attempt no sudden and forcible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>displacement of the mass of the negro race. Rather
he will establish local conditions that shall tempt
the younger and more enterprising negroes to
migrate of their own free will; while he will
probably fix by legislation a pretty distant date—say
five-and-twenty years ahead—after which
it shall be competent for the various State
governments<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c013'><sup>[70]</sup></a> forcibly to evict (with compensation)
and transplant to the new State any negroes
under, say, forty-five years of age still lingering
within their boundaries. There will be no need
at any time to disturb old or middle-aged negroes
who are disinclined to start life afresh under new
conditions.</p>

<p class='c001'>The probability is, however, that if once the
new State were judiciously set on foot, the difficulty
would be so to moderate the westward rush
as to prevent an unnecessary dislocation of the
labour-market in the South. Negro labour could
and would be gradually replaced by white labour;
but a sudden negro exodus on a large scale would
embarrass agriculture and other industries in most
of the Southern States. It would be one of the
main problems of the case so to regulate the
flow of migration as to make it continuous, yet
not excessive.</p>

<p class='c001'>There seems to be little doubt that the negro
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>race, as a whole, would welcome any reasonable
means of escape from the galling conditions of
their life in the South. On the other hand,
there is no doubt whatever that all the more
intelligent members of the race are staunchly
and even pathetically loyal to American ideals,
and would be very unwilling to live under any
other than the American form of government. In
the new State, they would be members of a
negro community without ceasing to be American
citizens. It might be necessary at first to establish
some provisional government like that of an
American territory or English crown colony; but
as soon as the country was sufficiently settled, and
the mechanism of life in full swing, there could
be no difficulty or danger in admitting the new
community into the Union, with full State rights.
Negro education has enormously progressed since
the bad old days of Reconstruction; and there is
no reason to doubt that the population could
furnish a competent legislature, executive and
judiciary. Legislative aberrations would be
checked by the Supreme Court of the United
States; and if things went thoroughly wrong,
and a new Haiti threatened to develop in the
heart of the Republic, why, United States troops
would always be at hand to hold a black mob or
a black adventurer in awe. But it would doubtless
be a fundamental principle that no white man
could vote or hold office in the negro State, while,
reciprocally, no coloured man could vote or hold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>office in the white States.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c013'><sup>[71]</sup></a> The abrogation of
the Fifteenth Amendment would remove from the
Constitution of the United States a constant
source of trouble.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am far from denying that this racial readjustment
would demand a huge effort and a very
large expense. In many individual cases it might
cause a good deal of hardship to people of both
colours. But that both colours would enormously
and permanently benefit by the effort seems to
me indubitable. It would be, before everything,
an act of justice to the negro. It would enable
him to build up a polity of his own, on lines to
which his mind is already habituated. It would
offer him full opportunity for the development of
his talents and ambitions, unhampered by any
social discriminations or disabilities. The Hampton-Tuskegee
movement has been fitting great numbers
of the race to carry out the necessary tasks
of construction and organization involved in the
material and moral upbuilding of the new community.
Every aid should, of course, be afforded
for the transference to the new domain of all
negro universities, colleges, and similar institutions.
I see little reason to doubt that the sense
of new and unhampered opportunity would stimulate
the mental and moral energies of the race,
and beget a higher competency, a new self-respect.
They would feel that they were on trial before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>eyes of the world, that their future was in their
own hands, and that they must vindicate their
claim to the rights and liberties of civilized
humanity. They would have a very fair chance
of success; and in case of failure they would at
worst relapse upon some sort of crown colony
government. A regularly established and benevolent
despotism would, at any rate, be better than
the capricious and malevolent despotism to which
they are now subjected in the South.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But,” it may be said, “the rights and
liberties of civilized humanity include the right
to move freely hither and thither over the face of
the earth. This right, at any rate, would be
denied to the Afro-American, inclosed within the
ring-fence of his own State.” There is, I think,
a sufficient answer to this objection. The right
to travel would not be denied to the negro. Nor
would he be debarred from emigrating and settling
abroad among any community that was willing to
receive him. It is, I think, becoming more and
more clear that the right of every man, white,
black, or yellow, to effect a permanent settlement
outside his own country, is subject to this qualification.
The idea that all the world ought to
belong equally to all men, and that rational
development tends toward an unrestricted intermingling
of races, seems to be signally contradicted
by the trend of events. Is it not the great
essential for the ultimate world-peace that races
should learn to keep themselves to themselves?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>If the negro State is established with any
success, I do not believe that its inhabitants will
feel it an undue restriction on their liberties that
they are forbidden to settle in other parts of the
Union. The population question will gradually
regulate itself. A fairly civilized people, with
limited opportunities of expansion, will soon realize
the penalties of breeding beyond its means of
subsistence.</p>

<p class='c001'>And what of the South, when this act of justice
to the negro shall have been performed? It will
awaken, as from a nightmare, to the realization of
its splendid destiny. No longer will one of the
richest and most beautiful regions of the world be
hampered in its material and spiritual development
by a legacy of ancestral crime. All that is best in
the South—and the Southern nature is rich in
elements of magnanimity and humanity—abhors
the inhuman necessities imposed upon it by the
presence of the negro. The Southern white man
writhes under the criticisms of the North and of
Europe, which he feels to be ignorant and in great
measure unjust, yet which he can only answer by
an impotent, “You do not know! You cannot
understand!”<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c013'><sup>[72]</sup></a> He has to confess, too, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>there is much in Southern policy and practice
that even the necessities of the situation cannot
excuse—much that can only be palliated as the
result of a constant overstrain to which human
nature ought never to be subjected. Remove the
causes of this overstrain, and a region perhaps the
most favoured by Nature of all in the Western
Hemisphere will stand where it ought to stand—in
the van, not only of civilization, but of
humanity.</p>

<hr class='c014' />
<div class='footnote' id='f47'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r47'>47</a>. Mr. A. H. Stone (“The American Race Problem,” p. 230) points
out that “the Latin’s prejudice of colour is nowhere as strong as the
Teuton’s.” In the same excellent book I find this sentence quoted
from “The Foundations of Sociology,” by Professor E. A. Ross:
“North America from the Behring Sea to the Rio Grande is dedicated
to the highest type of civilisation; while for centuries the rest of our
hemisphere will drag the ball and chain of hybridism.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f48'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r48'>48</a>. I jot down almost at random, as they occur in my notes, a few
statements on the population question.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. W. B. Smith, author of “The Colour-Line” (a strongly anti-negro
book), makes out that the negro population has since 1860
increased by about 1,100,000 per decade. Thus, in 1860, it stood at
4,400,000, and in 1900 at 8,800,000. Meanwhile the number of
negroes per thousand of the whole population has been steadily declining.
In 1860 it was 141 per thousand; in 1900 only 116.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the census of 1900, which gave the total population of the United
States as 75,994,575, the coloured population was set down at 9,185,379,
or 12·1 per cent.; but as the term “coloured” included 351,394
Indians and Mongolians, the actual number of negroes is reduced to
8,833,985. The coloured population of the South Atlantic and South
Central States is given at 8,001,557; and as Indians and Mongolians
are few in these regions, we may take it that the number of negroes
was nearly eight millions. The white population of these States
numbered 16,521,960, of whom only a little more than 2 per cent.
were foreign-born, as against 22·5 per cent. in the North Atlantic
division, and 15·8 per cent. in the North Central division. But, no
doubt, the next census will show a much higher percentage of foreign-born
whites in the South. See tables in “The Present South,” by
E. G. Murphy.</p>

<p class='c001'>From a carefully argued statistical paper by W. F. Willcox in
Stone’s “Studies in the American Race Problem,” it appears that,
taking periods of twenty years together, the percentage of increase in the
negro population of the United States has steadily declined. In 1800-1820
it was 76 per cent., in 1880-1900 it was only 34 per cent. Mr.
Willcox places the “maximum limit of probable negro population a
century hence” at 25,000,000, and thinks that by that time the negroes
will constitute only 17·8 per cent. of the population of the Southern
States, instead of 32·4 per cent. as at present.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f49'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r49'>49</a>. Mr. Thomas Nelson Page, in the third chapter of “The Negro:
The Southerner’s Problem,” takes a pessimistic view, arguing that the
apparent progress of the coloured population is “confined to the upper
fraction of the race,” while “the other nine-tenths, far from advancing
in any way, have either stood stagnant, or have retrograded.” His
argument leaves me unconvinced; and I think he gives too much
weight to the evidence of Mr. William Hannibal Thomas, author of
“The American Negro,” whose invectives against his own race are too
virulent to be accepted without the utmost caution.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f50'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r50'>50</a>. There seems to be no doubt that the economic and social future
of the South must be radically influenced by the campaign against the
hookworm—uncinaria—which, financed by Mr. Rockefeller, is being
actively set on foot. This intestinal parasite, which works its way in
through the skin, has only of late years been recognized and studied;
and as yet scarcely a beginning has been made in that cleansing of the
polluted soil which is the obvious and only method of mastering the
pest. Both races suffer from it, but the negro far less than the white;
and it is said that the laziness and shiftlessness of the “po’ white
trash” of the South is almost entirely due to the terrible anæmia
produced by its ravages. If this “poor white” population could be
converted from two million degraded paupers into as many healthy
and industrious citizens, the effect on the labour-market would certainly
be far-reaching. The disease ought to be a comparatively easy one
to stamp out; and, even when infection has occurred, it commonly
yields, in early stages, to a simple treatment.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f51'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r51'>51</a>. See foot-note, p. 190. The American use of the word “conservative,”
as employed above, is curiously illustrated in this sentence
from “The American Race Problem,” p. 247: “The position of the
more conservative, or liberal, section of opinion was that of attempting
to show the folly and injustice of attacking Roosevelt by an argument
based upon a comparison of the number of negro appointments during
his and McKinley’s administrations.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f52'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r52'>52</a>. In this connection it is perhaps worth noting that the hookworm—that
“vampire of the South”—is now pretty clearly proved to be an
importation from Africa. On the other hand, it is a far greater scourge
to the white than to the black race, the negro possessing a power of
resistance to its ravages which amounts almost to immunity.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f53'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r53'>53</a>. “It has become the fashion of late for certain negro leaders to
talk, in conventions held outside the South, of fighting for their rights.
For their own sake and that of their race, let them take it out in talking.
A single outbreak would settle the question.”—T. N. Page:
“The Negro: The Southerner’s Problem,” p. 281.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f54'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r54'>54</a>. This distinction is illustrated by the anecdote of a negro in a
Northern city going from door to door of a long street, asking for work
and food, and being everywhere met by a polite and regretful refusal.
At last he came to a door which was flung open by a man, who thus
addressed him: “You d——d black hound, how have you the impudence
to come to the front door! Go to the back door, ask for a
broom, and sweep out the yard.” “Bless de Lord!” said the negro,
“He’s led me to my own Southern people at last!”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f55'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r55'>55</a>. Negro labour is indispensable to the South only inasmuch as the
negro has kept and keeps out the white labourer. “Should the negro
be deported, there would be no trouble in filling his place with white
men, who would bring the South up to its proper agricultural standard.”
William P. Calhoun, “The Caucasian and the Negro,” p. 15. Mr.
A. H. Stone, a large employer of negro labour, writes: “It has been
the curse of the South for a hundred years that her people have clung,
and stubbornly, to a conviction, never reasonable or well-founded, that
negro labour was essential to the cultivation of her soil.”—“The
American Race Problem,” p. 174.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f56'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r56'>56</a>. See foot-note, p. 64.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f57'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r57'>57</a>. Mr. Booker Washington said to Mr. Wells: “May we not
become a peculiar people—like the Jews? Isn’t that possible?”
What so long kept the Jews a peculiar people was the constancy with
which Jewish women declined to intermingle with the Gentiles around
them. If negro women showed such a spirit of racial chastity, the
problem would be very different.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f58'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r58'>58</a>. On p. 47 of “Race Adjustment,” by Mr. Kelly Miller, a coloured
professor at Howard University, the author says, addressing Mr.
Thomas Dixon, Junr., “You are mistaken. The negro does not ‘hope
and dream of amalgamation.’... A more careful reading of the
article referred to would have convinced you that I was arguing against
amalgamation as a probable solution of the race problem. <em>I merely
stated the intellectual conviction that two races cannot live indefinitely side
by side, under the same general régime, without ultimately fusing.</em>” For
practical purposes, the difference is not great between “hoping and
dreaming” of amalgamation, and merely looking forward to it as
inevitable.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f59'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r59'>59</a>. Of course this does not imply that many individual negroes
would not be as unwilling as any white man or woman to marry outside
their colour limits.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is on the whole very difficult to state my point in the above
paragraph, without seeming to imply a great deal more of conscious
and formulated will than I am, as a matter of fact, assuming. There
are doubtless thousands of negroes who oppose a race-pride of their
own to the race-pride of the whites, and hundreds of thousands who
have no conscious desire whatever regarding the future of their race.
I am trying to state what I believe, rightly or wrongly, to be deep
instinctive tendencies, which seldom, perhaps, emerge into consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f60'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r60'>60</a>. This I wrote from deep conviction, yet with a certain sense of
daring; for I thought the idea entirely my own, and feared it might
give dire offence. More than a year later, I was reassured on reading
the following passage in “The Basis of Ascendancy,” by Mr. E. G.
Murphy (p. 52): “Much of the South’s talk against the negro has
therefore been the South talking to itself; it has been its rebuke, by
implication, of those corrupting elements within the limits of its own
life which answer to no high policy of social self-respect, to no fine
purpose of racial conservation, but which, under the lowest impulses,
would degrade the present and betray the future.”</p>

to note that I was struck by the immense preponderance of fair hair
and complexion among the women of the South. I would almost go so
far as to say that, with the exception of women who had obviously a
negro strain in their blood, I did not see a single brunette in the course
of my wanderings. As regards Louisiana, this no doubt only means
that I had not time or opportunity for adequate observation. But in
the case of the other States, I am inclined to think there must be good
grounds for the strong impression left on my mind.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r63'>63</a>. There is some conflict of evidence as to whether many persons of
negro blood “cross the line” or “go over to white”—that is to say
conceal and renounce the negro strain in their ancestry. Mr. Kelly
Miller states that, as a result of white persecution, “hundreds of the
composite progeny are daily crossing the colour-line and carrying as
much of the despised blood as an albicant skin can conceal without
betrayal.” (“Race Adjustment,” p. 49.) “Hundreds daily” is
probably an exaggeration; but it would appear that such cases are not
infrequent; and it is significant that negroes generally, instead of
resenting this disloyalty to their blood, enter into “a sort of conspiracy
of silence to protect the negro who crosses the line.” “Such cases,”
says Mr. Stannard Baker, “even awaken glee among them, as though
the negro thus, in some way, was getting even with the dominant
white man.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘That’s a fine home.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘Yes; stop a minute,’ he said. ‘I want to tell you about that.
The anti-kink man lives there.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘Anti-kink?’ I asked in surprise.</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘Yes; the man who occupies that house is one of the wealthiest
men here. He made his money by selling to negroes a preparation to
smooth the kinks out of their wool. They’re simply crazy on that
subject.’</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r65'>65</a>. This volume contains portraits of ninety-seven contributors to it,
whom I have roughly classified according to their features and apparent
complexion. There are only three whom one can put down as probably
pure negroes. Of the remainder, twenty-three seem to be predominantly
negroes, but clearly not pure-bred; thirty-four are typical
mulattoes (that is to say, appear to be half black, half white); in
thirty-three the features are almost entirely Caucasian, but the complexion
is unmistakably swarthy, while in five there is scarcely any
recognizable trace of negro blood. The decoration round the portraits
in this book is curious and instructive. It consists of a scroll-work
encircling two pairs of contrasted medallions. On the one side we
have a black slave being flogged, on the other a very light mulatto
writing in a study, surrounded with books; on the one side a negro
kneeling with broken fetters on his wrists, on the other a frock-coated
mulatto on a platform, with an ice-water pitcher on his table, lecturing
with gesticulation to a crowded audience.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r67'>67</a>. I do not dwell on his surely unadvised initial statement that the
“barriers” between white and black “are not different in kind or in
strength from those which once separated neighbouring European
tribes.” I presume that “once” must be taken as referring to pre-historic
ages, reconstructed on scanty ethnological evidence.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r68'>68</a>. Yet I cannot but call attention once more to the doubt even on
this point. See p. 108. The general manager (a Canadian) of the
company which laid down the street-car lines in Kingston, Jamaica,
reported that “the best and most reliable of the workmen were the
pure blacks. This was found to be invariably the case.”—W. P.

<p class='c001'><a href='#r69'>69</a>. Several of my critics, when this essay first appeared, misunderstood
this phrase. I do not mean that if the legal barriers were
removed white men would rush to marry black women. What I mean
is that, in a democratic community, the legal barrier could not possibly
be removed unless there had previously occurred a relaxation, or
rather reversal, of public sentiment with regard to mixed unions.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>I <br /> THE AMERICAN IN CUBA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>I have known few more curious sensations than
that of crossing in a single night from Florida
to Cuba: leaving the New World at ten p.m. and
arriving at six a.m. in the Old World. For
Havana is distinctly an Old World city—more so,
I am told, than some of the cities of modern
Spain. From the moment the steamer passes
between Morro Castle and La Punta, and skirts
beneath the grey and pink cliffs of the huge idle
fortress of La Cabana, one feels that one has
left behind the region of the Immature, and entered
upon that of the Over-ripe.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am not going to attempt a description of
Havana, with its many-coloured, swarming
Southern life; its arcaded side-walks; its huge
windows, all barred with ornamental ironwork,
at which a great part of the social life of the
city is carried on; its narrow business streets,
the Calle Obispo and Calle O’Reilly, in which
the frequent awnings stretched from house to
house create a rich golden shade; its grey old
cathedral; its cool green patios framed in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>gloom of high-arched gateways; its handsome,
rather commonplace, modern squares; its Prado
and its esplanade, where the restless purple waters
of the Gulf of Mexico fling up, every now and
then, white pillars of spray. Except for its
splendid harbour, the city has no great advantage
of situation, being placed on low hills, and surrounded
by others not much higher. The chief
impression it leaves on the mind is that of opulent
colour—often garish where the hand of man has
held the brush, but, where Nature has her own
way, in tree, shrub, soil, ocean, and sky, indescribably
and inexhaustibly gorgeous. A painter
of the temperate zone would here throw away
his palette, except, it may be, for the wonderful
blue distances, of which, on the outskirts, one
has now and then a glimpse.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Paradise Regained.</div>

<p class='c001'>From all that I could see and hear in Cuba,
I felt thoroughly convinced that American intervention
had amply justified itself,
and that this noble island, after
all its miseries and distractions,
was now in a fair way to become as prosperous
and happy as, by its natural advantages, it is
entitled to be. The splendid work of cleansing
and sanitation which the Americans have done
in Havana I more fully appreciated after a brief
inspection of a couple of unsanitated Spanish-American
towns—Cartagena and Barranquilla.
But cleaning-up and road-making, and the
organization of public services, are not all that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>the Americans are doing. In the Cuban guide-book
it was significant to note the number of
places which owed their fame to having been
the scene of this or that massacre or military
execution. It would be premature, perhaps, to
say that all that sort of thing is past and done
with; but there will certainly not be much more
of it; the United States will see to that. I am
bound to confess that here, in my opinion, the
Republic has “taken up the white man’s burden”
very efficiently and in a very true sense.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sense of prosperity was very strongly
borne in upon me in Vedado, a suburb of Havana,
whither I went to call upon an American gentleman,
resident for many years in Cuba, to whom
I had an introduction. Vedado is a great sun-baked
stretch of ground between the low hills
and the sea to the west of Havana, where handsome
bungalow-villas are rising in great numbers.
As yet it is in a somewhat raw and ragged
condition; but there is evidence of wealth and
activity on every hand.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Cuban Colour-Line.</div>

<p class='c001'>My primary object in visiting Mr. Ogden (as
I shall call him) was to inquire into the relations
of the white and coloured races in
Cuba.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is very obvious,” I said,
“in the streets of Havana, that, if there is any
colour-line here, it is not drawn anything like
as strictly as in the Southern States. I see a
good many black policemen; and there are black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>motor-men and conductors on the street-cars.
Among the passengers in the cars there is no
distinction of colour. In the Colon Cemetery,
as I came down here, I noticed that, among the
thirty heroes commemorated on the Firemen’s
Monument, four seemed to be pure negroes; and
there were negro traits in six or seven more. Is
there really no colour discrimination at all?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In the sense of legal disability,” said Mr.
Ogden, “there is none. Socially, of course, there
is a good deal, though no hard-and-fast barrier
is raised between the races. Each family, each
individual, draws the colour-line according to
taste. But, naturally, there is a tendency for
the pure white to exclude the unmistakably
coloured.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Would a white man lose caste on marrying
a coloured woman?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, very distinctly. I could tell you of
several instances.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But there is no serious friction—no feud—between
the races?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“At present, no; but I’m not at all sure that
a race problem may not declare itself when the
new Constitution comes into force in February
next. We shall then have the negro in politics;
and that is how trouble always arises.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You fear a Cuban repetition of the Reconstruction
time?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, indeed I do. The negro is susceptible
to every sort of political machination. Every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>carpet-bag demagogue can make a tool of him,
and that the Cuban white men won’t stand for.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Meanwhile, however, there is no trouble?
You have not any such Reign of Terror here as
there is some parts of the Southern States?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No. Outrages on women are practically
unknown here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how do you account for the difference
between Cuba and the Southern States in respect
to this class of crime?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, sir, I’m a Southern man myself, and
all I can say is that the nigger here don’t seem
to me the same as he is at home.
I believe it is partly a real difference
of race. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Pick of the Basket.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> You see, most
of the slave-ships used to touch at Havana before
they went on to Charleston or New Orleans;
and the Cuban planters used to make a study of
the different races and tribes, and select the best
types. The daughter of a very wealthy planter—she’s
an old lady now—has told me all about it.
They knew precisely the qualities of the different
breeds. Some were best fitted for body-servants,
some for field-work, some for handling stock,
others for educating and making clerks and book-keepers
of. So, you see, the Cubans got the pick
of the basket, and only the lower class—the mere
brawny animals—got to the United States.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This theory did not strike me as wholly adequate
to the case, nor did Mr. Ogden pretend that
it was. But there may be something in it, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>I commend it to the notice of students of negro
ethnology.</p>

<p class='c001'>“By-the-by,” Mr. Ogden continued, “there
is a curious African survival among the negroes
here—a sort of semi-religious society called the
Ñanigo, which indulges in strange rites of its
own, and occasionally in assassination.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When you say ‘semi-religious,’ do you mean
Christian or pagan?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, pagan entirely. The members are
generally tattooed or decorated with scars and
cicatrices. They come greatly to the front in
Carnival time, when they parade the streets,
carrying a sort of illuminated pagoda and making
strange noises by grating gourds.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Political Situation.</div>

<p class='c001'>The talk then strayed to politics, and Mr.
Ogden gave me a no doubt one-sided, but evidently
sincere, view of the situation.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I take it,” said I, “that Cuba
is now peaceful and contented?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh yes, fairly so,” said Mr. Ogden; “but
capital is still shy of coming in, until the political
condition is more stable.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What was the reason of President Palma’s
downfall?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The sole reason was that he was too good
for them—too honest, too scrupulous. Ninety-five
per cent. of those who took active part in
the revolution of 1906 were negroes, and the rest
were, with very few exceptions, men of no standing
whatever, either political or social.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>“The revolution was largely worked by the
editor of a popular paper, a very able man whose
sole moral quality is a total lack of hypocrisy.
He said quite frankly, ‘In the old days I was
always in touch with the Spanish Governor, and
all sorts of good things came my way. Now,
on the other hand, there’s nothing doing, and
it don’t suit me.’ For a short time I ran the
English page of his paper for him; and once,
when he wanted me to put in something that I
knew to be a blazing lie, I said to him, ‘I wonder
how you can reconcile it with either your principles
or your policy to print such an utter falsehood.’
He slapped his right pocket, and said, ‘My
principles are here;’ his left pocket, ‘and my
policy here.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Engineering a Revolution.</div>

<p class='c001'>“The chief of the secret service had warned
Palma for some time that a revolution was brewing—that
there was open talk in the
cafés of his assassination or deportation.
He only said, ‘Why, what is
there to make a revolution about? Our credit
is good, our public works are going forward,
prosperity is spreading. Where should the
revolution come from?’</p>

<p class='c001'>“A party of men were suborned to enter the
barracks of a company of rural guards, shoot all
the men in their sleep, and seize their arms.
This was to be the signal for a general rising;
but the bandits were left in the lurch by their
friends. Orders were given to take them alive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>or dead—preferably dead. Unfortunately they
were taken alive, and have all been released by
Mr. Taft, on the plea that their offence was
political.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then a man got up a revolution in a remote
province; which meant that he set a lot of niggers
looting stores and carrying off canned salmon, and
calico, and boots and shoes. A friend of his in
Havana went down to find out the reason of this
revolution. The leader explained that he had
7000 dollars of gambling debts which he couldn’t
pay; and for that sum he would order off the
revolution. The friend said: ‘You can’t have
7000, but I know of 3000 dollars allotted for a
purpose that can stand over; I think I can get
you that, and you can make a composition
with your creditors.’ The leader agreed to this
proposal, but Palma refused to sanction the
deal, and the rising went on, and spread, and
became serious.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Palma confessed to me that the only troops
he could rely on had only a few rounds of ammunition.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Foreign Legion.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘Why, then,’ said I, ‘there’s
only one thing to be done—we’ll
telegraph to the Colt Manufacturing
Company for twenty machine guns and a million
rounds of ammunition; and I’ll organize the men
to work them.’ Palma held up his hands in
protest. ‘A million rounds! Why, that’s enough
for a war!’</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Colt Company could only deliver ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>machine guns, but those we got; and I organized
a foreign legion. It contained Americans, Englishmen,
Frenchmen, Germans, Italians—450 men in
all. We were just ready for business when Mr.
Taft arrived with the Peace Commission; and
what followed I have never understood, and don’t
understand to this day.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We went on board the <cite>Des Moines</cite> to wait on
Mr. Taft. He said to me, ‘Mr. Ogden, I understand
you are an American citizen—then what
are you doing in that uniform, and under arms?
And that man there? And that man there?’ I
replied, ‘Mr. Taft, I have lived in Cuba twelve
years. This gentleman is an Englishman—he has
been fifteen years here. This gentleman is French—he
has been twenty years here. We have wives
and children here; and we have formed ourselves
into a foreign legion, because we think we have a
right to protect our families and to preserve the
peace.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘What do you want me to do?’ said Mr. Taft.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Muzzling the Machine-Guns.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> ‘The very thing you won’t do,’ said I. ‘How
do you know?’ he said. ‘I’m a
reasonable man, and I’m here to do
something. How do you know it
mayn’t be what you want?’</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘Well, sir,’ said I, ‘we want you to sit still,
and smoke your cigar, and do nothing.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘For how long?’</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘For twenty-four hours—at most for forty-eight.’</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>“‘And meantime,’ said he, ‘you propose to
keep the peace by committing an act of war?’</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘It won’t be war, sir,’ I said. ‘These people
can’t stand up for a minute before machine guns.
It isn’t in them. In the first place, they haven’t
more than six or eight rounds of ammunition
apiece, and you know you can’t make war with
six rounds of ammunition. But I don’t care
though they had a million rounds—they simply
cannot stand up. There’s no reason why they
should. There’s no patriotism, no principle
among them. They’re merely out for a little loot.
If you tie our hands, and give the country over to
this gang, Cuba will stink to heaven before many
months are over.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“But it was no use. Palma had to go, and
now we don’t know what lies before us.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It isn’t that the Cubans aren’t fit for political
life. Many of them are, perfectly. But with the
ignorant negro and low white vote, there is no
saying what may happen.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish to heaven President Roosevelt had
just added a few words of postscript to his message
to the Cubans. If he had only said, ‘Though we
intend that Cuba shall have honest self-government,
we don’t propose to put up with revolutions,’
all would have been well.”</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>II <br /> A GAME FOR GODS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A cloudlessly hot Sunday afternoon in Havana—I
am lounging in the Parque Central, when I observe
a poster announcing that a game of “Jai Alai” is
at that moment in progress. The very intelligent
“Standard Guide to Havana,” sold by Mr. Foster
(the Cook of Cuba), notes this “famous gambling
game” as one of the sights of the city; so I
charter a cab, and jog through the baking streets
to the “Frontón” in which it is played. You
first enter a long and evil-smelling hall, with
various refreshment bars, like the lower regions of
a hippodrome; and then you pass into the
“Frontón” itself. Imagine an amphitheatre
sliced in two at its longitudinal axis; one half
retained, with its shape unaltered, to serve as the
auditorium; the other half converted into a
titanic racquet court, 175 ft. long, 36 ft. deep, and
(I imagine) something like 40 ft. high. The long
wall, of course, fronts the audience, the two short
walls close in the ends. The floor of the immense
court is made of smooth and almost shining concrete;
the walls are of stone, painted chocolate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>colour, and the long wall is marked off by perpendicular
lines into seventeen compartments. The
purpose of this I did not understand, for play
takes place, not against this back wall, but
up and down the whole length of the great court.
Imagine, now, the great auditorium, tier on tier,
filled with a vast crowd of excited, shouting,
cheering men (there were only about a dozen
women present), while bookmakers in red Basque
caps move up and down in front of the first tier
of seats, and permeate the higher tiers as well,
yelling the odds in their raucous voices. As a
vehicle for betting “Jai Alai” is generally recognized
as “a curse to the community,” and the
American Governor has been much blamed for
tolerating it. But in itself,—as an exercise of
skill, endurance, strength, agility, and grace—I
do not hesitate to call it out and away the finest
game I ever saw.</p>

<p class='c001'>Readers who have been to Spain may recognize
this as the Basque game of pelota. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“Partido” and “Quiniela.”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> I had heard
its name; but certainly its extraordinary
merits had never reached
my cars. Probably it is too difficult
for the ordinary amateur; the professionals whom
I saw are engaged at large salaries, and showed
marvellous skill. But as a mere spectacle I should
think it would prove attractive anywhere.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c013'><sup>[73]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>game is perfectly simple to understand, and
there is never a dull moment in it, except the
few moments of rest which the players allow
themselves. Here is my guide-book’s account
of it:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>Attached to a leather gauntlet worn by the players is a

weighs about four ounces. The players are distinguished
by their dress as whites (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><em>blancos</em></span>) and blues (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><em>azules</em></span>). Two

five players participate, one against another in succession,
until the winner shall have scored the game of
six points.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><em>quiniela</em></span> seemed to me more graceful and
beautiful than the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><em>partido</em></span>, or foursome, if not quite
so exciting. The players wear the simplest costume—white
drill trousers and either white or blue
shirts. For a long time I was puzzled to think
what familiar object the “cesta” recalled to me;
but at last I hit on it—the thing is for all the world
like those wicker guards which linkmen put over
hansom-wheels, to save the gowns of ladies in
alighting. The basket is, I take it, about two feet
long. When a player lets his arm drop from the
shoulder, the tip of the “cesta” is about level
with his ankle.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, how shall I describe the actual play?
It is racquets enormously magnified, and carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>to an almost superhuman pitch of skill. Only
once does the player touch the ball with his hand,
and that is in leading off. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Playing the Game.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Standing
about the middle of the court, he
drops the ball on the floor, catches
it with his “cesta” in the rebound, and sends it
whizzing against the end wall. It flies back like
a streak of lightning, and instantly one of the
other side has it in his “cesta,” makes two or
three leaps to give himself impetus, and hurls it
again at the end wall. This time it is not
improbable that he has put such force into his
cast that the ball rebounds the whole 175 feet,
strikes the opposite wall, and flashes down to the
floor. Then one of his opponents must be ready
to take it on the hop, and, reinforcing its movement,
to send it flying once more against the end
wall, of course doing his best to “place” it
awkwardly for the other side. I have seen the
ball returned thirty times in a single rally; but
the average number would probably be some
twelve or fifteen. And almost every catch and
return seemed an incredible feat of skill. Just
consider: here is a space of 6300 square feet, and
only two players on each side—in the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><em>quiniela</em></span> only
one. What astounding rapidity of eye and agility
of limb it must take to be always at the right spot
to catch a little demon of a ball, that tears flashing
about the court like a thing possessed! And the
men are almost always at the right spot. They
may misplace the ball or send it “out;” but it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>the rarest thing for the ball to escape them
entirely. They run, they leap, they make the
most amazing whirling strokes; if the ball comes
very low, they fall down, and often hurl it with
the greatest accuracy from the most unconventional
positions on the ground. Not once but
hundreds of times that afternoon did I see things
done that looked absolutely impossible. Perhaps
their variety of resource is their most astonishing
quality. But, wonderful as it all is, it is still more
beautiful. With all their rapidity, their grace is
perfect, like that of lithe, resilient, feline animals.
If anything more marvellous or more graceful was
done at the Olympic games, then the Greeks were
athletes indeed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Certainly, if one wanted to gamble, “Jai Alai”
provides an intensely exciting method of doing
so. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Fluctuating Odds.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In one <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><em>partido</em></span> that I saw it
seemed at first that the “blancos”
entirely outclassed the “azules.”
They gained about 8 points to their rivals’ 3—the
game being 30 up. But gradually the blues crept
forward, until at 14 they tied. Then the whites
spurted, and presently the score was 24-19. But
again the blues pulled themselves together, and
at 26 they again tied. The whites, however,
were the better team, and in the end won by
2 points. Of course, at every fluctuation of the
score, the odds varied: when the twenties were
reached the betting became fast and furious, and
both bookmakers and their “clients” shouted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>themselves distracted. But there is no reason in
the nature of things why this exquisitely beautiful
game should be “soiled with all ignoble use.”

  <h3 class='c012'>III <br /> A FRAGMENT OF FAIRYLAND</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Allowing time for a few hours’ stay at Matanzas,
the journey from Havana to Santiago di Cuba
occupies two days and a night. At Matanzas,
a town in itself of no great interest, it is well
worth while to climb to the hermitage of Montserrate,
which overlooks to the westward the Yumuri
valley, a great semicircular basin in the hills, and
to the eastward a magnificent sweep of sea and
shore. The endless colonnades of palm-trees give
to the distant slopes an exquisite tone of silver-blue
such as I have never seen anywhere else.
On the whole, however, the Cuban landscape, as
it presents itself between Havana and Santiago, is
rich and spacious rather than specially beautiful.
Its characteristic aspect is that of wide and fertile
plains, with ranges of high hills, or low mountains,
in the distance, dappled with the shadows of the
clouds; but in the central province of Camaguëy
the hills disappear, and the plains become rather
uninteresting, and to a considerable extent unimproved.
The general impression of fertility is
very striking. The soil is often of such a rich red
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>or chocolate colour that it seems as though an
artist need only mix a little oil with it and transfer
it to his canvas. The species of palm which
prevails in Cuba has an unfortunate tendency to
bulge in the wrong place, and assume a bottle-like
contour, which is fatal to the beauty of the
individual trees. Patches of inextricable jungle
are not infrequent in the central districts, and
suggest a use for the huge, broad cutlasses—the
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><em>machetes</em></span>—with which the negro peasantry are
generally armed. As the line bends southward to
Santiago, I fancy that the scenery becomes more
mountainous and picturesque; but we ran through
it in the dark. I retain only an impression of
dense forests jewelled with myriads of fire-flies,
while some sort of cricket or cicala made a
pleasant tinkling sound, as though of running
water.</p>

<p class='c001'>Santiago I take to be one of the hottest places
in the universe. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Santiago to Kingston.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is set in a vast basin of
splendid hills, the bottom of the
basin being formed by the lake-like
expanse of the historic harbour. The
gulf or fiord so narrows towards its mouth that no
sign of the open sea is visible, and no breath of
sea breeze seems ever to stir the mirror-like
surface of the lake. The red roofs of the town
climb up the hill from the water’s edge, and seem
to glow and flame in the fierce sunlight. One
envied the little brown and yellow urchins running
about stark naked in the shady side-streets. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>they wore anything at all, it was a necklace—an
amulet or charm, as I conceive.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c013'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From Santiago I took ship for Jamaica on the
S.S. <cite>Oteri</cite>, the most uncomfortable vessel on which
I ever set foot. It belongs, I am told, to the
Cuba Eastern Railroad, which is largely an English
company. Surely it would pay them to assign a
habitable ship to the service, and thus encourage
travellers to adopt this otherwise delightful route.</p>

<p class='c001'>Over the passage I draw a veil. We wound
our way down the narrow neck of the fiord (sacred
to the memory of the heroic Hobson), passed
under the bluff crowned by the bastions of Morro
Castle, and plunged into the rollers of a marvellous
sapphire sea. From that time, I remember
nothing for about eighteen hours, except the truly
infernal heat of a grimy little oven, facetiously
described as a stateroom. Next morning, when
I came on deck, the blue mountains of Jamaica
were towering over us, and we were heading for
the low spit of Port Royal, which forms, as it
were, the breakwater of Kingston Harbour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of Jamaica I shall say very little, for the
simple reason that my feelings concerning it are
beyond expression. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The City Desolate.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The burden of
my message is, “Go and see it.”
Until you have crossed the Blue
Mountain range of this incomparable island you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>do not know what Nature can achieve in the
creation of pure beauty. In Italy Nature is
helped out by art, by architecture, by the magic
of antiquity, by all sorts of historic associations;
and it would, of course, be ridiculous to under-value
these advantages. Here beauty has no such
adjuncts; if it is enhanced at all by the intervention
of man, it is by mere accident. Comparison,
then, is futile; but with the liveliest memory of
many of the loveliest scenes in Italy, I say
deliberately that I did not know what pure beauty
meant until I visited Jamaica.</p>

<p class='c001'>But I did not learn it in Kingston. Rebuilding
had scarcely begun in that luckless city, which
can at no time, I fancy, be very attractive. It
was, to put it briefly, the abomination of desolation.
The heat in the long, straight streets was
torrid; and all the mortar that ought to have
been in the house-walls was blowing about in the
form of scorching and stinging dust-clouds. So
I presently shook the dust of Kingston, not so
much off my feet as out of my eyes and lungs,
and (under the advice of kind friends at King’s
House), set forth on a short tour, of which the
first stage was a railway journey to Port Antonio.</p>

<p class='c001'>Never shall I forget that afternoon. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Midsummer Day’s Dream.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Perhaps
it impressed me the more because I had not been
led to expect anything unusually
beautiful. Between Kingston and
the old capital, Spanish Town, the
route was of no great interest; but no sooner had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>the train passed Spanish Town, and begun to
creep up into the hills which form the backbone
of the island, than I found myself in a valley of
enchantment. A gorge rather than a valley—a
winding, Highland glen, with a clear blue river
flowing musically down its rocky bed, and a white
road following the curves of the stream. Everywhere
were glorious forest trees and slender palms—very
different from the paunchy Cuban species—with
an underwood of the richest tropical
growths. The banana groves, sometimes mixed
with orange trees, were numberless, and at almost
every turn huge clumps of feathery bamboos were
mirrored in the stream. The giant limbs of the
forest trees were often clad for their whole length
with the tender green of thick-clustering ferns.
As for the temperature, it was perfection. I can
only describe it by a contradiction in terms—very
warm and yet beautifully cool—whereby I mean
that, though the thermometer was doubtless high,
the delicate freshness of the air, the clearness of
the water, and the depth of the green shadows
through which we were running, produced a perfect
illusion of coolness. Slowly as the train
meandered along, it went far too fast for me. I
was tortured by a desire to linger, to get out and
walk, to fix in my mind some of the ever-shifting
aspects of beauty. Presently—all too soon—we
reached the top of the pass and began to wind
down the wider valley on the other side. Beneath
jag-toothed mountain walls in the grey distance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>spread a labyrinth of crinkly hills, all tending to
a pyramidal form, and many of them crowned
with red-roofed cabins or wattle huts. Down
their corrugations flowed exquisitely limpid brooks,
and up their sides climbed forests of broad-leaved
bananas. On every hand were palms, oranges,
and brilliant flowering shrubs. It gave one an
odd little shock to see at a wayside station, amid
all this wealth of tropical colour, a patch of homely
British vermilion in the shape of a mail-cart inscribed
with the familiar “E.R.” At times the
train would plunge into tunnels, just long enough
to afford a pleasant pause in the overpowering
feast of beauty; then out again to serpentine
along amid fairy dells and dingles each lovelier
than the last. As we drew downwards, the
noble mountain background began to flush in
the evening light; and at last we ran out into
the wide bed of a torrent debouching in a sweep
of purple sea. This was Annotto Bay; whence
the line skirts round headland after headland of
the romantic coast to the bright little town of
Port Antonio.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here I spent a perfect tropical day. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>At Port Antonio.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The
great American caravanserai on the promontory
between the two bays was closed;
so I went to the pleasant little
Waverley Hotel on the neck of
land at the base of the promontory. Through
the still hot hours of blazing sunlight, I sat in
the airiest of attire on a shady verandah, writing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>some of the foregoing pages, while the vulture-like
“John Crows” wheeled solemnly around, in sedulous
devotion to their craft of scavenging. The
waters of the smaller bay were lapping at my feet;
and I looked out over their blue expanse to a little
red-and-white light-house on the opposite head-land,
and the white walls of an American millionaire’s
villa gleaming through a forest of palms.
In the cool of the afternoon, I climbed to a small
plantation on the top of a hill some seven or eight
hundred feet high, almost perpendicularly overhanging
the town. Nothing more glorious can
be conceived than the falling of the purple twilight
over the innumerable folds of the foothills filling
the bottom of the great basin of mountains to
the south; while northward lay the measureless
expanse of the sleeping Spanish Main. It was
a scene of sheer enchantment. I lingered until
the great stars began to blaze in the crystal deeps
of heaven; then took my way downward, unutterably
moved, as by some august and gorgeous
ritual. In the town, the lamplight was glowing
through the walls of the houses—for here, as often
as not, the walls are of pivoted slats which open
and close like Venetian blinds. The streets were
swarming with a dusky throng, and a band of
black Salvationists was making an unholy clatter
under the star-sown silences.</p>

<p class='c001'>But I must cut short my Jamaican raptures,
and not attempt to express the inexpressible.
Starting from Buff Bay the next morning, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>seven o’clock, under the guidance of a negro
whoso regal name was Clovis, I rode all day long
up a valley of paradise, into the
heart of the mountains. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Valley of Paradise.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Sometimes,
when the road skirted a ravine, we
would look down a hundred feet or so, and see
shining brown bodies plashing about in the
silver pools, flecked with sunlight through the
overarching palms. More than once, in some
sequestered nook, we came upon a negro family
party performing an elaborate go-to-meeting toilet—for
it happened to be Sunday, and the road was
populous with worshippers, all of whom gave us
a grinning good-day. While we took our midday
rest at a hospitable plantation, half ruined by the
earthquake, a deluge of rain came down and lasted
over an hour; but when we rode forward—now
on a mere bridle-path winding along the sides of
often precipitous gorges—it was wonderful to see
the clouds rolling up like giant curtains from
the glittering mountain-sides. On we clambered
over the watershed, and a little way down the
southern valley, to the plantation of Chester Vale,
3000 feet high. There I spent several delightful
days of work and mountain wandering, on which
I must not allow myself to enlarge. Almost
every afternoon—for it was the rainy season—there
came a tropical downpour. But rain itself,
in this climate, is a thing of beauty and of joy;
and as for the lifting of the clouds and breaking
through of the evening sun, who shall describe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>the splendours of the spectacle? Perhaps the
most beautiful of all my experiences was an early
morning ride from Chester Vale along the ridge
to Newcastle, on my way back to Kingston. Such
ferns, such exquisite wild flowers, as lined the
path, I have seen nowhere else; and the view
from our shady fringe of the forest, over the sunbathed
valley fading away to the northern sea,
was sumptuous in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c001'>I cannot better sum up my impressions of
Jamaica than by saying that there was scarcely
an hour of my brief stay in the island which I
would not willingly have prolonged indefinitely.
Again and again—many times in the day—I
would feel, “Why cannot the sun stand still?
Why must this marvellous moment pass away
before I have absorbed a hundredth part of its
beauty? Why is there no means of ‘fixing’ on
the memory, as on a photographic plate, the
details of this heavenly scene?” We have all,
I suppose, experienced these moments of exasperation
at the tyrannous march of time; but
I have never known them come crowding upon
me as they did in Jamaica. In a very real sense,
the island is too lovely; one is sated, surfeited
with beauty. I should hesitate to live there, lest
perchance I should sicken of Nature’s prodigality.
But for a month or two, or for a winter, nothing
could be more fascinating. And Jamaica, in my
experience, has few or none of the usual draw-backs
of the tropics—poisonous insects, snakes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>and so forth. It is the nearest conceivable
approach to an earthly Paradise. It is a fragment
of Fairyland.</p>

<p class='c001'>To confess the truth, I was too much occupied
in sheer enjoyment of life during my stay in
Jamaica to pursue with any ardour
my researches into the race-problem.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Black, White, and Coloured.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But I saw enough to realize the
heaven-wide difference between this black community,
administered by a benevolent but scarcely
qualified despotism, and the piebald democracies of
the Southern States. There were in Jamaica, in
1905, 15,000 whites, ten times as many “coloured”
people (that is to say mulattoes), and nearly
630,000 blacks. In other words, the white population
of the island is smaller than that of Rugby,
the non-white population is larger than that of
Manchester and Salford. There are fifty-five non-whites
to every one white. Moreover, the terms
of the enumeration point to a characteristic difference
between the United States and Jamaica.
In America, every one with the smallest strain of
African blood is black, though he may, in fact,
be as white as George Washington. “Coloured
man” and “negro” are synonymous, there being
no legal, social, or statistical distinction between
the pure black and the mulatto. We have seen
how impossible it is to arrive at anything but
a merely conjectural estimate of the relative
numbers of the pure and mixed breeds. But
in the West Indies <a id='corr272.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“coloured’'>“coloured”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_272.31'><ins class='correction' title='“coloured’'>“coloured”</ins></a></span> means “not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>black” as clearly as it means “not white.”
The “coloured” population is a middle class
between the white aristocracy and the black proletariat;
and whereas in America there is almost
complete solidarity of feeling and interest between
the mulatto and the negro, I am told that in the
West Indies the “coloured” man despises the
“nigger,” and feels himself immeasurably his
social superior.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c013'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This means that no real race-problem exists
in Jamaica. There may be a certain amount of
marginal friction and unpleasantness where the
coloured population, the intermediate stratum,
touches the black basis of society on the one
hand, and the white upper-crust on the other;
but these difficulties are not essentially different
from those which necessarily arise in any community
which includes a large class of indeterminate
social standing. There is, in fact, none of <a id='corr273.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='that,'>that</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_273.19'><ins class='correction' title='that,'>that</ins></a></span>
race rivalry which declares itself where two races
are practically equal in numbers and theoretically
equal in political status. The integrity and the
social position of the white race are absolutely
unthreatened. They are, like the English in
India, a small body of “sahibs” in a non-white
country. The situation in Jamaica, in fact, has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>scarcely an element in common with that of the
Southern States.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are, I believe, some slight stirrings of
democratic ambition, and of resentment at their
lack of political rights, among the
Jamaican populace—especially in
the small class of urban negroes.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Let Well Alone?<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It would be absurd for me to offer an opinion
as to whether they have any substantial and
practical grievance. But I confess I could not
work up any enthusiasm for the “elevation”
of the Jamaican masses. Beyond a little better
sanitation, I do not know what they want. They
seemed as happy as South Sea Islanders, and
much more tenacious of life. Both the coloured
population and the black population have nearly
doubled within the past half-century. From the
point of view of the white employer, no doubt,
it is highly desirable that, as Mr. Booker Washington
puts it, they should “want more wants:”
more civilization would mean more stability and
industry, with less inclination to “prædial
<a id='corr274.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='larcency'>larceny</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_274.24'><ins class='correction' title='larcency'>larceny</ins></a></span>.” But from the point of view of the
black man himself, the benefits of progress seem
far more questionable. I read without the appropriate
sense of horror that “not more than half
of the native population is effectively reached by
religious and educational influences,” and that
60 per cent. of the births are illegitimate. It
seems to me that the Jamaican negro enjoys
all the advantages of the primitive life without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>its disadvantages, whereas the American negro
(broadly speaking) is subjected to all the evils
of civilization, while he receives but a disproportionate
share of its benefits.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>IV <br /> THE PANAMA CANAL</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>When, in New York, I was handed a sailing-list
of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company’s
boats, I observed that their first port of call,
after Jamaica, was Colon. In vain I hurriedly
searched the map of the Caribbean Sea, hoping
to disguise my ignorance. I had to pocket my
pride, and inquire, “Where is Colon?” Afterwards
I discovered that Colon was a place of
which I had often heard under its earlier name
of Aspinwall; for my father, one of the Californian
Argonauts, had twice crossed the Isthmus
of Darien in the old days.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under no conceivable name would Colon be
an attractive place. It is situated on flat ground
(formerly an island) at the bottom of a little bag
of a bay; it consists of the ordinary jerry-built
two-storey houses of a more or less improvised
tropical sea-port; its fringe of palms is meagre
and mangy; and it is backed by low and featureless
wooded hills.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, as we steam slowly up to the jetty,
what is this cluster of some twenty or thirty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>neat new houses, under a grove of palm-trees
away to the right? There is something odd
about them, something dark and blind-looking;
they seem to have neither windows nor doors.
After a little searching of spirit, I realize what
they suggest to me—they are like a row of giant
meat-safes.</p>

<p class='c001'>And there, at the point of the spit of land,
is a statue—a group of two figures. Now I
know where I am, for I have been reading things
up a little. This must be the statue of Columbus
embracing an Indian maiden, presented by the
Empress Eugénie in the palmy days of French
ambition regarding the Isthmus; and the houses
behind it must be those of the American officials
in the settlement of Cristobal, a suburb of Colon.</p>

<p class='c001'>One soon learns to appreciate the “screened”
houses of the Canal Zone, with their verandahs
enclosed in an impervious veil of wire gauze.
But outwardly, and especially at a distance, they
are not things of beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Three minutes in the broiling streets of Colon
were quite enough for me. I have seen frontier
settlements before now; and Colon, though it has
a sort of a history, is at present, to all intents and
purposes, a frontier settlement. “Do you know
Port Said?” a resident said to me; “Well, this
place is just about 50 per cent. wickeder.” I
think the resident (with pardonable partiality)
exaggerated a little; but the aspect of Colon,
even by day, was quite sufficiently sinister.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Besides, I had an important introduction to
present at Panama; so I took the first train
thither. This railway, or at any rate a railway
more or less on the line of this one, was built
in the ’fifties, and is said to have cost a life
for every tie (<em>Anglice</em>, sleeper). Literal-minded
persons question this statement; to me it seems
entirely probable. For if ever there was a pestiferous-looking
region, it is this land of swamp
and jungle and blood-red river. Though I knew
that science had practically annulled the evil spell
that had so long rested on it, there were still places
which I could scarcely look at without a shudder.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course the Canal works, and the settlements
of the workers, give an air of great animation to
many points on the line. But apart from these
I saw not a single sign of life on the whole route;
not a square inch of cultivation, not a man or
woman who looked like a peasant of the region;
only a few undaunted cattle browsing here and
there in the swamps. And every here and
there, to add to the desolation, lay great pieces
of machinery—travelling cranes, trucks, even
engines—overturned by the wayside and half
submerged in jungle. They were relics of the
French fiasco, the abandoned impedimenta of
De Lesseps’ Moscow. I have seen few more
tragic spectacles.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here let me say, however, that intelligent
Americans speak with great respect of their
French predecessors. “Consider the difficulties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>they had to deal with,” a high official said to
me—“difficulties that we have had practically
swept away for us! They knew nothing of
tropical hygiene, and malaria and yellow fever
had it all their own way with them. They knew
nothing of cold storage, and the problem of supply
was practically insoluble. Considering all these
circumstances, it is wonderful what they did, and
did well. If it bears a small proportion to the
£50,000,000, more or less, that were sunk in the
enterprise, you must remember that probably not
half that sum of money ever got to the Isthmus.
Their material was all excellent. We use a considerable
amount of it to this day. We have dug
many of their locomotives out of the jungle, and
found them practically as good as new. When
we took over the business, there was a great
outcry over the £8,000,000 we paid to the French
Company. People said it was grossly extravagant;
but we have found that the bargain was a good
one.” Despite all alteration of plans, I gather
that about half the excavation actually made by
the French has proved, or will prove, useful.</p>

<p class='c001'>As one leaves the station at Panama, one fears
that it is to prove a second Colon. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Sanitary Campaign.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Here are the
same two-storey shanties, half of
them, it would seem, drinking-bars,
and the other half miscellaneous
stores, kept by the ubiquitous Ah Sin and Wong
Lee. But after half a mile or so of this Hispano-Americano-Chinatown,
the Avenida Central leads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>one into the moderately old and not quite uninteresting
Spanish city, with its Plaza, its twin-towered
Cathedral, and its fort. And when you
get to the fort, you find yourself on the central
promontory of one of the most beautiful bays in
the world; but of this more anon, from another
point of view.</p>

<p class='c001'>The towns of Panama and Colon are specially
excluded from the Canal Zone—the strip of
territory extending five miles on each side of the
Canal, which the United States has bought from
the Republic of Panama for £2,000,000. But
even in these two towns the Americans have
undertaken the work of paving and sanitation;
the outlay to be repaid by instalments extending
over fifty years. So they have repeated here
the drastic cleaning-up which they have effected
in Havana, even outraging the feelings of the
natives by abolishing the domestic rain-water
butt, the breeding-place of the “Anopheles” and
“Stegomyia” mosquitos—disseminators, respectively
of malaria and yellow fever. It is mainly,
though of course not entirely, by waging war
upon these insects that the now almost perfect
sanitation of the Canal Zone has been secured.
And it is in order to exclude them from the
happy home that all the I.C.C.—Isthmian Canal
Commission—houses are “screened” with wire
gauze.</p>

<p class='c001'>To one of these houses, in the suburb of
Ancon, I drove in the early afternoon, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>presented my introduction, which was honoured
with true American cordiality. Once within the
gauze fortification (and the door shuts behind you
with a spring, lest you should inadvertently admit
a casual Anopheles) you find yourself in a delightfully
arranged tropical house, with dining-room
and drawing-room opening off a central hall, and
with the spacious verandah affording what is
equivalent to another suite of rooms. It is built
entirely of hardwood, painted in white and shades
of green, and is as cool and airy as heart can
desire. From within, the “screen” is scarcely
noticeable; in the normal Panama weather, indeed,
it merely softens agreeably the glare of the
sun outside.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is this,” I asked, “the famous house that
was built in some incredibly short space of
time?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” said my host, laughing. “That story
has got around a good deal, but it has the merit of
being true. When the house was begun, I saw
that the workmen were simply dilly-dallying over
it and making no way. I spoke to our chief,
Colonel Goethals, about it, and he came over
and looked at the preparations, so far as they
had gone. He said to the overseer: ‘This house
must be finished and ready for occupation on the
15th of November’—just six weeks ahead. The
overseer pulled a very long face, and said, ‘I’ll do
my best, sir.’ ‘That was not my order,’ said
Colonel Goethals. ‘I did not tell you to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>your best—I told you to have the house finished.’
And finished it was, in just thirty-six working
days.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After taking me for a most interesting drive in
the environs of Ancon, my host was compelled, by
a previous engagement, to leave me
to myself for the rest of the  evening.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“A Peak in Darien.”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> I did the obvious thing, which was
to climb Ancon Hill at sunset. To do so you have
first to wind your way through the beautifully
situated hospital buildings, all, of course, carefully
screened in gauze. Straying a little from the
proper road, I came across a lumber-yard, outside
of which I was a little startled to find a pile of
some fifty coffins of assorted sizes. These, too,
might, I thought, have been “screened” without
disadvantage to the spirits of the community.</p>

<p class='c001'>A stiff climb of about half an hour brought
me to the top of Ancon Hill, and disclosed one
of the loveliest views I have ever seen. Immediately
below lay the town of Panama on its
promontory. To the left a huge bay curved outward,
with a magnificent sweep, and beyond it
range on range of mountains grew ever dimmer
and more distant as they faded away into South
America. To the right of Panama lay the
smaller bay of La Boca, in which the canal
will actually debouch, studded with beautiful
mountainous islands, not at all unlike those of
the bay of Naples, on a smaller scale. It was
a glorious scene; and a white American cruiser
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>lying out in the anchorage gave a pleasant touch
of life to it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Observe that I have said “to the left” and
“to the right” of Panama, not to the south and
to the north; for the orientation here is extremely
puzzling. I naturally expected to see the sun
set over the Pacific; but, to my great surprise,
there seemed to be no sun in the heavens in
that direction. Yet the light proved that a
sunset was going on somewhere; and, turning
inland, I found the luminary engaged in sinking
behind the mountains of the Isthmus—to the
eastward it seemed to me. A study of a large-scale
map may show the reason for this paradox—I
shall not attempt to expound it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Isthmian Canal Commission has built and
runs a delightful tropical hotel at Ancon, called—heaven
knows why—the Tivoli.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Tivoli Hotel.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Even the negro waiters wear at
their belt the brazen badges or
checks showing their numbers on the I.C.C. pay-list.
Salaries are paid to numbers, not to names.
Many of the labourers have no ascertainable, or
no spellable, name; many change their names as
the fancy strikes them; but their badge identifies
them at once.</p>

<p class='c001'>The telephone in my bedroom rang at 5.30 the
next morning, for I had to catch a train at 6.35 to
meet my Ancon friend at Culebra, several stations
down the line. On the way, I saw a gang of black
convicts working at an embankment. The black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>and white stripes of their trousers were conspicuous:
less conspicuous the chain attaching
one leg of each man to a large bullet. A negro
in khaki uniform stood sentry over them with
fixed bayonet.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, it appears, surprisingly little serious
crime in the Zone. There are three district
judges, who, sitting in banc, form a supreme
court. Trial by jury has recently been introduced,
on the theory that the Constitution follows
the flag. Two cases have been tried by jury: in
the first a white man was acquitted who ought
(said my informant) to have been found guilty;
in the second, a negro was (justly) convicted with
promptitude and despatch.</p>

<p class='c001'>After breakfast at the delightful house of one
of the officials at Culebra, my kind cicerone and
I sallied forth to visit the famous Culebra Cut.
But, while waiting for our motor to appear, he
showed me two of the characteristic institutions
of the Zone.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Club House.</div>

<p class='c001'>The first was an I.C.C. Club House—a
spacious and admirably arranged recreation-home,
containing a library, reading and
writing rooms, billiard-room, gymnasium,
skittle alley, and theatre for amateur
performances and minstrel shows.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The great enemy we have to fight,” said my
friend, “is not the climate, and still less disease,
but the monotony of the life. You cannot get
good work out of discontented and homesick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>people—you cannot even retain their services.
So it has been one of our most essential tasks
to organize amusements, and make the leisure
time of our people agreeable. This Culebra club-house
is one of four already built, at the cost of
about £7000 apiece. The others are at Empire,
Gorgona, and Cristobal; and we have four or five
more in contemplation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And to whom are the club-houses open?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To all Gold Employees; and the dues are
only one dollar a month.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Gold Employee means, on the face of it,
the man or woman whose salary is calculated in
United States currency, while the Silver Employee
is the labourer, white or black, who works at so
much an hour, calculated in the currency of
Panama, in which a dollar is equal to just half
the American or gold dollar. But to all intents
and purposes, so far as I could make out, the
Gold Employee is the white American, the Silver
Employee is everybody else. There are 6000
American employees of the Commission; and,
counting officials of the Panama Railway and
women and children, there are altogether about
12,000 Americans on the Zone. The total number
of employees varies considerably, but is somewhere
about 40,000.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second institution to which my friend
introduced me was a Commissary Store, of which
there are half a dozen in the Zone. In this
large and roomy building commodities of every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>description are dispensed to employees of the
Commission. I say dispensed, for nothing is
bought for money. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A Socialistic Store.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Everything is
paid for by coupons various values,
issued to employees alone—the object
being to ensure that none but they shall benefit
by the institution. As the region is almost
wholly unproductive, everything has to be imported
from New York, New Orleans, and other
points of the United States, from one to two
thousand miles distant—the “perishables” being
handled by a magnificent system of cold storage.
As everything is supplied virtually at cost price,
the Canal employee on the average pays for what
he consumes rather less than he would in New
York.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But, my dear sir,” I said, as we left the
Commissary Store, “this is sheer unmitigated
State Socialism.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know it,” he replied, “but I have always
thought that Socialism under Carlyle’s ‘benevolent
despot’ would be no bad thing. And we
flatter ourselves that, in the I.C.C., the benevolent
despot has, for once, been discovered.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Our motor had by this time appeared—a motor
running on the railroad—and we set off. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Culebra Cut.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> First
we ran down the ordinary passenger
track to Las Cascadas; and there, by
means of an ingenious portable turntable,
we faced about and got ourselves switched on
to rails leading to the Cut. Times out of number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>had our motor-man to jump off and turn the points
so as to run us into a siding while some huge
“dirt train” rumbled past. The rule is that
everything must give place to a “business” train.
Only for the President of the United States was
the line cleared.</p>

<p class='c001'>Up in the North, an old soldier of the Union,
now one of the most delightful of scholars and
critics—why should I not name Professor Lounsbury?—had
said to me, “I thought that the
charge of Pickett’s Brigade, on the third day at
Gettysburg, was the greatest sight that I ever
had seen or would see; but the Culebra Cut
really rivalled it.” I was curious to see where
any analogy could lie between two such disparate
spectacles; and, frankly, I could find it only in
the cannonade of dynamite through which we had
occasionally to run. But unquestionably the Cut
is a wonderful spectacle, a tremendous demonstration
of human and mechanical energy.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is simply the transformation of a mountain
into a valley. Imagine all the biggest railway
cuttings you have ever seen ranged into a sort of
giant stairway, along the two sides of a great
prism-shaped valley; and imagine all these cuttings,
at a dozen different levels, being daily and
hourly deepened by an army of machines and men.
The activity is enormous. Here we have whole
companies of drills of various kinds boring the
rock to be charged with dynamite; a little farther
on we pause at a given signal, and presently come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>five or six detonations, one after the other, like
a sharp discharge of artillery. The usual charge
is about three hundred pounds; but on one occasion
twenty-three tons were used in a single
explosion, to blow away a whole hillside. When
the ground has been loosened, or “fired,” as they
call it, along comes that mammoth earth-eater,
the steam-shovel, with its attendant train of dirt-cars,
digs its shining steel teeth into the hillside,
and munches it up at the rate of five cubic yards
to a mouthful. These giant mouthfuls it spits
out again one by one into the flat “Lidgertwood”
cars on the adjoining track, five or six mouthfuls
(I forget the exact number), constituting a carload.
The train of some fifteen cars is, in fact,
a long platform on wheels; for iron aprons join
car to car and make the platform continuous.
The cars, moreover, have but one side, so that,
when the train arrives at the dumping-ground, a
sort of steam plough is dragged by a cable along
its whole length, and its huge burden of rock and
soil is discharged in a very few minutes. For
another consistency of soil, a tilting form of dirt-car
is used. In short, no possible time- or labour-saving
device is neglected. Even the shifting of
temporary railway tracks, which is constantly
required, is effected by a machine, which lifts
whole sections of rails and “ties,” and deposits
them in their new location.</p>

<p class='c001'>Along the whole length of the Cut we made
our way, zig-zagging from level to level. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Engineering Difficulties.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>we were in the very bottom of the “prism,” and
the two sides of the eviscerated mountain were
towering above us, I inquired what
was to be the ultimate surface level
of the water, and found that the
surface level had not yet been reached by many
feet.</p>

<p class='c001'>For about half its length, the Canal will not
have the aspect of a canal at all, but of a great
lake. The low lands of the northern side of the
Isthmus are to be entirely flooded by the damming
at Gatun of the Chagres river. This lake-reservoir
will have a surface area of about one hundred and
ten square miles, and will serve as a regulator of
the water supply. For instance, such a sudden
rainfall as would cause the Chagres river to rise
thirty-five feet in twenty-four hours, will raise the
water in the dam only about three inches.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is whispered in Colon that there is still
one great engineering difficulty in the way of the
enterprise, and that is to find an adequate foundation
for the huge Gatun Dam. Whether such
a difficulty exists I cannot say, but, if it does,
I am very sure it will be overcome. Croakers
also declare that it is well known that the proposed
width of the locks at Gatun and La Boca
(100 feet) will be quite inadequate for the greater
Dreadnoughts and Lusitanias of the future, but
that the engineers dare not tackle a larger “proposition.”
These are very likely the idlest of
rumours. The quidnuncs of Colon do not observe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>the admirable resolution adopted by the Cristobal
Women’s Club, namely, “That every club-woman
in the Canal Zone constitute herself a committee
of one to foster favourable instead of adverse
criticism of the conditions of the Zone and of the
Isthmus of Panama.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Triumph of Organization.</div>

<p class='c001'>We had just dodged our way through the Cut,
when the eleven o’clock whistle sounded, and
work ceased for the “noon hour”
of eleven to one, essential in this
climate. We were thus enabled to
make a pretty clear run into Panama. A recent
rainfall had left some standing water along the
line, and wherever we saw a pool we saw, too,
a negro treating it with a can of crude petroleum.
The mosquito has indeed a poor time of it in the
domain of the I.C.C.</p>

<p class='c001'>Regretfully I bade my hosts farewell and took
the 5.30 train for Colon. As the twilight fell,
about midway across the Isthmus, I saw, on the
same patch of green, one set of negroes playing
baseball, and another set playing cricket. The
latter were, of course, Jamaicans, asserting their
privileges as citizens of the British Empire. This,
I am told, they are very apt to do, in and out of
season. The moment they consider their dignity
outraged, their retort is, “Let me tell you, sah,
I am a British subject.” And, truly, for men of
their hue, it is better to be British subjects than
American citizens.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was at Colon, the same evening, that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>heard those questionings as to the engineering
success of the Canal which I have recorded above.
Neither of its scientific nor of its political aspects
do I profess to judge; but I am much mistaken
if the organization of the enterprise be not an
achievement of which America has good reason
to be proud.</p>
